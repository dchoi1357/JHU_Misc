Virginia Elizabeth Koestner, 97 of Centerville passed away Wednesday, March 13, 2019 at her home she shared with her daughter.
Virginia was born in Moravia to Grant & Bess (Veach) Everman on November 2, 1921.
She received her education from Centerville Schools, graduating in 1939, one year after Centerville High School burnt to the ground.
She was active in band and orchestra.
On November 9, 1941, Virginia was united in marriage to John Koestner in Centerville at First Lutheran Church less than a month before WWII was declared.
Their marriage survived 62 years through thick and thin.
As Pops always bragged he knew how to pick a good one and he certainly did.
He preceded her in death on July 18, 2004.
Both did what the “Greatest Generation” did during the war years.
Cindy was a byproduct before he shipped off overseas to save the world from his cousins in Germany and son Kris who was part of the “Baby Boomers” after the war.
Mama was a lifelong Republican until Trump came along which made for many lively discussions; her son thought that it was important to keep her blood pressure up.
Virginia worked her entire life within the family businesses, not always by choice from her and John’s venture at the Blue Bird Café starting in 1958 through 1968 on the Centerville square where all members of the family started a tradition of working together and being involved.
Then later with John and son Kris they opened the J&K Market, with her grandson Chad joining later, making it a 3 generation business that lasted 48 years on the Square.
During this same time period the family created a niche market with the J&K Barn that lasted 30 years where hundreds of banquets, weddings and dances were held.
This is where grandson Mike learned knife, fork and spoon.
There was no dishwasher except for Mama and good friend Pat Cisler, who washed thousands of dishes.
Mama would also assist in working with her son and grandson at J&K; becoming famous for her homemade pies.
In the early days of the Good Ship J&K, Virginia loved making brownies for the party cruises. 
Virginia enjoyed bird watching; daily readings of her bible, newspapers and church bulletins.
She was always happy clipping articles from papers and bulletins to make scrap books for her family.
In her later years, Virginia and John spent countless evenings on their front deck at the J&K cabin overlooking the pond watching the birds, wildlife, sunsets and stars.
A few years after John’s passing, Virginia moved in to town to be with her daughter Cindy; this brought out the good and bad with any Mama and daughter close relationship.
It was a win-win situation for Mama.
Being a few steps away to the door of our church, First Lutheran.
She enjoyed being close to the church and Pastor Kathy Franzenburg, which made it possible to remain active within First Lutheran and Karen King, who became almost like a daughter to her and her good friends Mike and Kay Toom.
Virginia was a 78 year member of First Lutheran Church.
Survivors include her children: Cindy Keene, Kris Koestner, grandchildren: Mike Keene, Tina Koestner, Chad Koestner (Courtney), TJ Carson-Koestner (JC), great grandchildren: Quinton, Alyssa, Zander, Maclin, Kinzie and Tegan.
She was preceded in death by her parents, husband, “Honest John”, favorite son-in-law, Roscoe Keene, siblings: Patsy Everman, Bart Everman and Nancy Blazina (Ed).
Funeral service will be 1:30 pm, Monday, March 18, 2019 at First Lutheran Church in Centerville with Rev. Jeremey McElvain officiating.
Interment will follow in Oakland Cemetery next to her husband John.
Visitation will be Sunday, March 17 at Thomas Funeral Home from 12-4 pm with the family present from 1-4 pm.
