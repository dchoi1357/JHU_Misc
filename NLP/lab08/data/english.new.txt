 The trail left by the passage of heroin and cannabis is evident, especially in Kosovo's capital city, Pristina.  By Natan Dotan for Southeast European Times in Pristina - 20/01/03 According to WHO/UNICEF, 11.6 per cent of young people interviewed in Pristina during a recent survey on youth and substance abuse said they have experimented with heroin. The survey also found that 6.4 per cent of youths interviewed in the province had tried the drug - a figure which places Kosovo high on the list of European regions afflicted with heroin use. The police response has been sporadic. 
 While a matchbox full of cannabis, about 3 to 5 grams, costs around 5 euros in Kosovo, on the streets of New York City the same amount may fetch between $17 and $30.The demand for drugs in Kosovo is not exclusively limited to illegal narcotics. 
 There, they organise concerts and theatre performances, discussions, workshops, exhibitions, dancing and music. They form a high school newspaper in each city, leaving all the necessary equipment and money for printing on their departure. 
 But after a one-hour break, DOS managed to bring in several breakaway Socialist MPs, who are holding their seats illegally with the ruling coalition's permission. 
 Dani Rodrik, the well-known Harvard University academic, aptly observed that there is no modern economy that does not blend the public and the private spheres. 
 Financial markets - under the pressure of volatile capital flows - function precariously, and the system needs revision. 
 Finding money to buy food doesn't come easily after she pays her telephone and electricity bills. 
 Trnka, 72, a tiny, wren-like woman with fluffy brownish hair and sharp dark eyes, said that it doesn't help matters that she has to buy medicine for her bad heart."Nothing's free, everything's 5 or 10 [DM] apiece," she said, sipping coffee in her house in Sarajevo's hilly Breka neighbourhood. She said that one of her sons, who's a writer, tries to help her out when he sells some books. 
 All of them expected Yugoslavia -- which distributed kingly pensions on par with salaries every month -- to take care of them. 
 Serbians are so anxious to work (the country's unemployment rate is about 40 per cent) that they'll take jobs in "grey economy" companies that don't pay taxes, health care or pension contributions. 
  Entity Agencies Putting BiH on Tourist Map  10/03/2003 Entity tourism agencies are hoping that by joining together to promote BiH, they'll change the country's dubious image abroad, boost the economy and make people here see their own country in a new light.  By Beth Kampschror for Balkan Times in Sarajevo - 10/03/03 Suggest Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to the average person intending to travel in Eastern Europe and they will likely shudder at the mental pictures the country's name conjures up - marketplace bombings, burning villages and busloads of refugees. 
 "It should be clear that the Neretva is beautiful, that it needs to be taken care of. 
 In an interview with Southeast European Times correspondent Slobodanka Jovanovska, he discusses the Adriatic Charter and Macedonia's relationships with the United States, NATO and the EU.  By Slobodanka Jovanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 31/03/03 Southeast European Times : This month, Washington will put its signature on the Adriatic Charter for a partnership between Macedonia, Albania and Croatia. 
 EU forces should replace the NATO troops in Macedonia this month, but the Macedonian government is still looking for protection from Washington. 
 In January, ruling Justice and Development Party leader and current Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a radical change in his country's policy on Cyprus and for the resumption of talks. Glafcos Clerides, the longtime representative of the Greek Cypriot community, hoped to cap his career with a reunification deal. 
 The autonomy of economic policy would be severely constrained even during the pre-accession period and may reduce considerably the capacity to deal with adverse shocks. The "political economy" of enlargement is also an issue to consider. 
 The experience of Portugal, Spain and Greece shows what tremendous progress can be made by making good use of EU structural funds. More resources have to be assigned, via the public budget, to education and health care services. 
 His inspiration was a visit to the St Archangel Monastery at Teovo village, where his grandfather was a donator. 
 After his grandfather told him that a "few pictures are missing" at the monastery, Stefan began to paint. When his parents asked him what he was doing, he answered: "It is very difficult for me, but I have to paint. 
 I deem his results extraordinary, and I admit I could easily see them hanging in the halls of major European and American museums where this kind of abstract art is exhibited."To date, Stefan has completed about 300 paintings, using ecological acrylic paints on cardboard. 
 She had just graduated from the University of Southern California with a double degree in biology and political science when Mehic called her, proposing that she do an internship in BiH."I was thinking 'she is crazy,' because I'd never been back," Ejupovic said, having left Sarajevo for Zagreb in 1992, moving on to the United States with her family four years later. But she gave it a try. 
 But she'd applied for an EU master's programme where she would study both in Italy and at Sarajevo University, and her parents were softened by the fact that she'd be in school. 
 Things are moving, but it's just a question of how much energy I have," she said. While Ejupovic returned to BiH for longer than she'd originally planned, one young woman involved in Reconnect said that she sees her return as just a first step in a globe-trotting career. 
 Use of EU funds should be seen in the wider context of a country's ability to use all available resources, whether domestic or imported, productively. A distinction should be made between an acute shortage of resources and the capacity to absorb them efficiently. 
 Poor countries, despite their hunger for resources, generally have a limited capacity to absorb funds efficiently, to a large extent because of their precarious institutions. 
 While absorption capacity can be seen in a static or dynamic way, in both cases this capacity is variable -- at any one point in time, a country can use more or less resources less or more efficiently. 
 The formation of coalitions of interested parties in favor of reforms is also a variable. It is not sufficient to examine a country's absorption capacity in a purely national context. 
 If Croatia, for instance, achieves better economic performance, its hopes of being put on a faster accession track -- on par with Bulgaria and Romania -- could turn into reality and the country would be entitled to more assistance. For reasons such as those highlighted above, policymakers in each country need to better define the challenge of absorption capacity, analytically and operationally. 
 It is important to learn from other countries' track records in using such funds in order to avert avoidable errors. Absorption capacity should be related to budget policy and its capacity to provide public goods. 
 The paucity of public resources is an additional argument for raising awareness about the importance of using EU grants wisely, and for a skillful budget policy which aims at providing badly-needed public goods. Accessing EU grants productively requires a systematic concern for raising local absorptive capacity; this, in turn, depends on a major overhaul and reform of public administration. 
 Beneficial projects should be embedded into multiannual budgeting programmes of ministries, with careful monitoring of their implementation so that waste and fraudulent diversion of resources can be avoided. 
 Inflation is quite low in most of the countries, but the foundations for steady growth are precarious, and there is heavy reliance on foreign assistance. 
 Today, Croatia is enjoying a renaissance as tourists rediscover the charms of this Southeast European jewel.  By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 07/07/03 Croatians hope that the upcoming summer season will be a success story and that the influx of guests will have a strong impact on the country's economy. 
 As the first organised groups arrive and the season gets under way, early indications suggest there is much cause for optimism. During the Easter holidays, accommodations filled up -- a good indicator for the peak months on the Adriatic coast, July and August. 
 During the first weeks of June, groups from Scandinavia and the United Kingdom visited famous Croatian holiday destinations -- islands such as Krk, Brac, Hvar and Pag; the Istrian peninsula; and the celebrated city of Dubrovnik at the country's southernmost point. In Croatia, 100,000 jobs are related directly or indirectly to tourism. 
 Pictures of Croatian landscapes and seaside are being broadcast on major television channels throughout the year. The country has become a popular summer spot not only for tourists from all over Europe, but for a huge number of celebrities who are just starting to discover the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea. 
 The government has developed a plan for renovating and refurnishing them, so that their capacities could be used for purposes of tourism. Croatia has clean and unpolluted seas with a remarkable coastline, more than 1,000 islands, untouched nature, ancient monuments and a rich cultural and historical heritage. 
 Its delicious cuisine, seasoned with olive oil and homemade traditional spices, and its fine wines can be enjoyed at prices which are still reasonable compared with Western European countries. Each year, the country tries to offer more -- cultural events, open-air concerts, film festivals, music shows and entertainment programmes. This year will see some major developments and results of improvements to theinfrastructure. 
 He started on the day of love and finished on the day where all men are created equal, live in liberty and pursue happiness."Enver Hoxhaj, a professor at the political science department at Pristina University, believes Steiner's first big success was the movement toward creating the first multiethnic government based on the Constitutional Framework of Kosovo. 
 These results can be classified under certain sections including networking/partnerships, media/promotion and research/training. 1) Networking/partnerships.  Partnerships have been built with civil society organisations, governmental agencies, international bodies (UNDP, UN Volunteers, the OSCE, the WHO, the British Council, the Lincoln Centre, and the embassies of the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany and the United States), and the private sector (AMC-Albanian Mobile Company, the largest mobile phone company in the country; Top Channel, a local television station). 2) Media/Promotion.  The campaign was highly visible one, with widespread media coverage in print, television and radio. 
 Other widespread activities, such as the MJAFT Bus Caravan tour, collected hundreds of activists across Albania for a seven-day tour through the country to promote the campaign in over 20 cities. 
 Publication of university student statistics was made possible by a nationwide survey released on 31 March, which revealed that students lack access to essential facilities at universities throughout Albania. 
 Other MJAFT! activities included protests, public debates, city hall meetings, a marathon run, a theatre performance, a street fair and an exhibition. SE Times : How has the campaign been received? 
 Bus Caravan put it, "Albanians from all walks of life, the leaders of our society, our intellectuals, our students, our teachers -- we are all calling for change. 
  Andreas Loverdos: Western Balkans Are a High Priority for Greece  18/08/2003 Greek Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Andreas Loverdos talks about the importance of bringing the former Yugoslavia into the EU, security for next year's Olympic Games, and Greece's recent presidency of the EU in this interview with Southeast European Times correspondent Athanassios Papandropoulos.  By Athanassios Papandropoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 18/08/03 Southeast European Times : Greece would like to see the former Yugoslav republics brought into the European fold, and in many cases into the EU. 
 The DSOG will co-operate with many Olympic and national organisations, including an Olympic Consulting Group, which is a working group of seven members -- one each from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, France, Spain and Israel -- with immense experience in security matters. The DSOG has already completed the strategic, tactical and operational planning of the Olympic security measures and has carried out a multitude of drills, with even more planned until the Games begin. 
 The EU should offer a serious police mission on the ground which will be integrated with their monitoring teams, integrated into the EUFOR chain of command and which will be able to do a serious job. SE Times : Macedonians believe that the United States favours Albanian interests in the region and that there is a strong partnership between Washington and Tirana. 
 The Macedonian media should pay more attention to these concrete steps and should stop referring to some kind of "special relationship" between Washington and Tirana. SE Times : Do you think Macedonia made the right choices in supporting the United States on Iraq and the International Criminal Court (ICC) issue? Joseph : With the request to sign the ICC agreement, Macedonia was put in a very difficult situation by the United States and the EU, and the government managed as well as it could. 
 I think it helped very much for Washington to use the constitutional name of the country. 
 Of course, there are still many problems on the ground, especially for isolated Macedonian villages. 
 How, after all, does one measure that which is officially ignored and often strives to remain hidden?In one recent study, economists Friedrich Schneider and Dominik Enste attempted, among other things, to compare official GDP statistics to estimates based on electricity consumption. 
 There is a strong and well-established empirical relationship between electricity use and overall economic activity; by comparing the official numbers to those predicted by power consumption, it is possible to get at least a rough idea of the size of the unofficial or informal economy. Using this methodology, Schneider and Enste found that the informal sector contributes substantially to total output throughout the developing and transition economies. 
 There is, therefore, much less urgency at present about bringing the informal sector into the official net. A number of researchers have tried to estimate the size of the informal sector in SEE economies. 
 What is the position of the Committee on this issue? Taseva : Soros undertook concrete research into corruption in higher education. 
 Berlin's Transparency International also did some research into the bribery index and showed that corruption exists in education, the judiciary and the highest structures of power in Macedonia. 
 We had meetings with the rectorates of the Skopje and Bitola Universities and agreed that they were the most accountable for taking measures to regulate university operation and thwart corruption. SE Times : Is the government courageous enough to deal with the problem? Taseva : The government started working on a paper intended to outline a strategy. 
 Economic distress in most of Africa, as well as in parts of Latin America and Asia, is accompanied by faltering institutional structures, by social fragmentation and disintegration, and by interethnic conflicts and violence. 
 The institution has entered a new phase, now that the Macedonian government has approved a draft bill setting the stage for it to become the country's third state-run university. 
 Though located only 500 metres away from the South East European (SEE) University, it continues to draw students. 
 Registering for exams or inquiring about course schedules, they crowd the entrance of the new building which became the university's new home in 2000.Tetovo University opened in 1994, resulting in a police raid. 
 Until 2000, it organised instruction in private homes in the village of Mala Recica. 
 The entire village, in fact, was put into the service of the university and became a student compound, complete with accommodation, cafes, and other hallmarks of university life. 
 The university administration was also located there. 
 The other is SEE University, a private institution that receives support from the EU. 
 Students are drawn to Tetovo University in part because of the relatively low cost of studying (only 150 euros annually, as opposed to 800 euros at SEE University), and also because it is a symbol of ethnic Albanians' desire to be able to study in their mother tongue. 
 Although graduates of Tetovo University have faced problems with their diplomas because the university was not officially recognised as an institution in Macedonia, this will change in the future. After parliament passes the law establishing a third university, a complex process of accreditation will follow. 
 According to Culture Minister Azis Polozhani, the newly-legalised Tetovo University will likely become operational in the 2004-2005 academic year."It could possibly become operational as early as next year although we are entering a legal procedure that has to meet all legal obligations derived from the law itself," Polozhani said. 
 Four departments -- the Faculty of Science and Math, the Faculty of Humanities and Arts, the Faculty of Economics (with courses that will not overlap those of SEE University) and the Faculty of Law -- and one polytechnic will be legalised under the Bologna model, with a credit transfer system enabling students to move to other institutions in Skopje, he explained. Education courses will be offered by the Faculty of Pedagogy, part of the Faculty of Humanities. 
 About 2m euros will be spent annually on the four faculties and the polytechnic. Asked whether a merger of Tetovo and SEE Universities is under consideration, Polozhani said "our goal is to form this higher education state-run institution, and they will know how to follow the relations between each other.""The government will make an effort for Tetovo University to start operating legally next autumn, even though it is hard to meet the deadlines because a very burdensome work is ahead," Vice Education Minister Tale Geramitcioski said. According to Tetovo University Rector Nexbedin Beadini, the institution will remain in its current location, which offers the possibilities of expansion. 
 He said 10,151 students have registered at the university since 1994 and their current number is 5,000.The Rectorate will move into the Tetovo Tabak building located at the entrance to the town. 
 Accommodation for about 3,000 students is also planned there. Earlier this year, Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski called legalisation of Tetovo University "another huge step in the implementation of the Framework Agreement."According to Democratic Union of Integration leader Ali Ahmeti, "overcoming the fear that education of Albanians in Macedonia endangers the country is the most essential achievement."The opposition VMRO-DPMNE party, however, has denounced the planned legalisation, saying there is no need for a third state-run university. 
 "The draft bill for establishing the third university approved by the government solves the Tetovo University problem rather than the issue of higher education of Albanians," said Trajko Slaveski, a member of the Executive Committee of the VMRO-DPMNE.The Albanian Democratic Party (DPA) has also condemned the bill, arguing that the government proposal is only a partial solution. 
 She argued that the nightclub is actually owned and operated by her husband's brother and father, and that her husband has nothing to do with it, other than ordering a drink once in awhile. 
 According to the public opinion research agency Strategic Marketing, Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia is gaining in the polls. 
 That could mean stabilisation of the world market, while new investments are expected throughout the Balkans as a result of next year's Olympic Games in Athens. 
 So, our ultimate priority has to be to build a highly-trained, professional and credible multiethnic police structure trusted by all citizens, regardless of their ethnicity. 
 In the 1970s, another famous sociologist, Daniel Bell, upheld the primacy of knowledge and theory-related activities in ordering our life and fostering man's technological and economic ascendancy -- implying that economic wizards could secure a foolproof policy. Even the clash between Keynesianism and monetarism, as the two main competing macroeconomic paradigms, could be seen in the light of searching for the ultimate piece of wisdom. 
 Last, but not least, globalisation -- as an incarnation of unfettered markets and the downsizing of government, operating worldwide -- also provided an impetus to the vision of an "'ideal" type of economic policy. At the start of the new century, facts are disavowing oversimplifications. 
 Otherwise, under increasing pressure from foreign markets and other threats (including terrorism, illegal immigration and spreading diseases), governments would resort to national means of protection -- such as trade protectionism, trade clashes and competitive devaluations. Ideology is not dead. 
  Construction of Durres-Kukes Road a Priority for the Albanian Government  03/11/2003 At a meeting chaired by Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano, the national council of roads approved a challenging project to build a road linking Albania's main port, Durres, with the northern city of Kukes. 
 The road will not simply end in Kukes, but will link up with Morina, on the Albania-Kosovo border, thus providing a connection between Pristina and the Adriatic Sea. 
 The EIB has provided funds for the 34km segment of the road linking Vlora city with Fieri, which will cost 17.5m euros. 
 For the road connection with Macedonia, work is going on in the Qukes-Qafe Thane, Peshkopi-Blace and Gorice-Liqenas segments. Another key part of the national strategy is the establishment of links with the seacoast tourist areas. 
 The Vlora-Saranda road along the country's southern seacoast, the Velipoja road in the northern seacoast area, and the Divjaka and Seman roads in the middle part of Albania are all being constructed with this goal in mind. 
 Can you give us details of its mission and how it would be employed? Jones : The role of the NATO Response Force (NRF) is to provide an integrated and fully interoperable sea, land and air capability, under a single command, wherever the North Atlantic Council requires, to prevent conflict or threat from escalating. The exact missions have not been determined. 
 But local NGOs say the report boosted efforts to fight the spread of AIDS in the region.  By Liz Barrett for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 01/12/03 The number of people infected with HIV in Southeast Europe is nothing compared with other regions of the world, such as Africa or parts of Southeast Asia. 
 The low penetration of the disease to date could be seen as a big opportunity -- a chance to prevent an epidemic. 
 Local NGOs are taking some impressive steps to grasp this chance and save Balkan youth from the disease. A successful campaign against HIV and AIDS needs several elements. 
 This makes them a liability, since they could continue to pass on the disease for years before finding out that they are HIV-positive. A priority for local NGOs is lobbying the health authorities to provide free and confidential testing facilities. 
 Vladan Golubovic of CAZAS is most proud of his organisation's peer education programmes for secondary school and university students. 
 As a result of all these factors, sexually transmitted diseases spread quickly in the region. The wars in former Yugoslavia have also played a role. 
 Focus groups run as part of the campaign showed that young people are very willing to talk about these issues and debates were heated. But while trendy publicity and advertising can help persuade young people of the need to have safe sex, it still takes courage to overcome the embarrassment of buying condoms. 
 On one hand, one can find features of capitalism in Europe that are distinctly different from what is generally called the Anglo-Saxon variant, as well as from the type encountered in Asian affluent societies. 
 But a Community Revitalisation programme is bridging those gaps and helping to regenerate towns and villages.  By Liz Barrett for Southeast European Times - 15/12/03 Robert Putnam famously wrote that too many people in modern America find themselves "bowling alone", meaning that local communities have broken down and society has become much more individualistic. 
 The region is full of towns and villages in desperate need of reconstruction and regeneration, but lacking the finance or will to get things done. 
 In general, the programme seeks to boost the local economy in some way, by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), building new infrastructure, targeting a part of the city for regeneration, or by investing in so-called 'soft infrastructure', including training programmes for local residents. 
 Maric said that the new law might stipulate that the fee be included in home telephone bills -- as the telephone companies are notorious for cutting service to people who owe even small sums -- which could mean a collection rate of 65 per cent within two months."There's a big danger that people will think that if we get that money we don't have to change anything else," he said, adding that they'd have to improve both production and the quality of their employees. Maric said he realised that job cuts are part of reform. 
 With the majority of Kosovo's population living in villages, it is in rural areas that poverty poses the most serious problem. 
 Also in blogs this week: Rule-bending in the Romanian workplace, translation issues in the tourism industry, and an OXFAM volunteers' quest to raise a new bridge in a stranded Albanian village.  By Balkanblogs for Southeast European Times � 21/01/07 With software companies better able to crack down on piracy, some people find they're having to make tough choices, according to  Grigor Gatchev . 
 "You know, I can suggest something that would take care of your registration problems for good." 
 Elsewhere: OXFAM volunteer Rachele De Felice has been trying to raise money to build a new bridge in the small village of Ure e Shtrentje, in northern Albania, reports  peshkupauje . 
 Mountain torrents tore the old bridge away a few years ago, dividing the village. 
 Not only are half of the residents unable to visit the nurse or go to school, but the only road out of the village is on one side of the gorge. 
 Ironically, the village's name literally means "expensive bridge". 
 "This is also the amount of money that would take a family of four to a vacation on the southern Black Sea coast towards the end of the season.

 "Beside posthumously undermining the victims and additionally hurting people close to them, as well as their compatriots, [this] makes it difficult for those who above all care for the fulfillment of justice, the punishment of crimes, and introduction of the mechanism for local, regional and international prevention," Milic i Milic suggest. 
 Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, who recently acknowledged that Romanian children have been sold over the Internet for up to $50,000, has said that the country's child protection system has been cleared of corruption. In 2000, there were over 57,000 children living in private and public care centres. 
 That number has dropped to less than 50,000 in 2002, while the number of children in foster care increased to nearly 38,000 in January 2002 from over 30,000 in 2000. 
 Since early 2001 the government has built 60 family-style foster care homes in place of the 47 large old-style orphanages it has closed. 
 Turkey has outlawed a number of other Islamist parties over the past decade. Erdogan, a former mayor of Istanbul, was banned because of a 1998 conviction for reading in public a poem which judges said incited religious hatred. 
 Erdogan removed his name, but remained AKP leader."Resigning as a founder but continuing as leader ... was a clear sign of defrauding the law," Kanadoglu said in his charges against the party. According to a diplomat in Ankara, the chief prosecutor's move could harden "support among the party's 10 per cent Islamist hard core", though it could also scare off many conservative-minded voters. 
  Washington Says Yugoslav Companies Helping Iraq Develop Cruise Missile  30/10/2002 The United States delivered new evidence to Belgrade indicating that state-run arms dealer Jugoimport has been involved in helping Iraq develop a cruise missile.  (BCC - 29/10/02; The Guardian, Hoover's, Radio B92, Tanjug - 28/10/02; The Washington Post, BBC - 27/10/02; Reuters, AFP, RFE/RL - 25/10/02; Institute for War and Peace Reporting - 24/10/02)Yugoslav scientists have been working on the development of a cruise missile for Iraq and have frequently visited the country to implement the project, the United States said in a document delivered to authorities in Belgrade. 
 The Washington Post quoted him as saying the contracts came down "to overhauling older-generation aircraft engines, rather than to selling state-of-the-art weapons."But senior officials in Belgrade said the US-gathered evidence does not support Kostunica's statement. 
 Talks with the US private equity group Advent International are due to begin by the end of this week; the privatisation agreement must be sealed by mid-December.

 Ashdown said the victory by nationalist parties could scare off investors and countries that have been aiding BiH to the tune of $5 billion over the last seven years. He added, however, that the vote did not necessarily mean a return to nationalism, since the winning parties have also been promising reforms."If those parties that aspire to government in this country mean what they say about joining the reform movement, if they are really prepared to back up their words with deeds, then let them begin by ... playing their part in implementing these reforms without delay," Ashdown said. One such reform will be to transform the Council of Ministers, which currently functions as BiH's central government. 
  Balkan Countries Moving Towards Common Electricity Market  08/11/2002 Eight Balkan countries will sign a Memorandum of Understanding on 15 November as a step towards the creation of a common electricity market, ultimately to be integrated into the EU's internal electricity market.  (RFE/RL, BTA, Seeurope.net, Online.bg - 15/10/02; Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe)Eight Balkan countries will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 15 November in Athens as a step towards the creation of a common electricity market, ultimately to be integrated into the EU's internal electricity market. The project covers Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania and Yugoslavia. 
 Implementation is expected to bring increased reliability, lower operating costs and better services, and will reduce the need for additional investments in new electricity generation capacity. 
 By 2005, non-household consumers will be able to buy electricity directly from the generating utilities. By signing the MoU, the countries will commit to move quickly in transforming their production and transmission companies into legally independent units with their own accounting, as required under the EU Electricity Directive. The project was proposed by the European Commission in close co-operation with the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, which supports projects in four areas: integrated border management, institutional capacity building, support for democratic stabilisation, and support for the integration of the region's transport, energy and environmental structure. 
 The Stability Pact has so far provided a total of about 3.46 billion euros in financial support for 46 projects. Stability Pact Special Co-ordinator Erhard Busek hailed progress towards the Athens agreement during a visit to Tirana last month, describing it as a "breakthrough". 
 In fact I saw it twice," said Carole Mitchell, a British Embassy employee in Sarajevo who has been taking in MESS performances for three years in a row. 
 "MESS is a very good festival, but there is always a problem of accessibility because of the language barrier," Mitchell said, adding that her favourite annual festival in Sarajevo is the music-based Bascarsija Nights. 
 One of the conclusions drawn from the survey that produced the index is that media freedom depends on a country's material prosperity: a democratically elected government does not guarantee press freedom. The index was compiled on the basis of answers given by journalists, researchers and legal experts to 50 questions covering the whole range of press freedom violations - arrests and killings of journalists, censorship, pressure, state monopoly ownership, legal restrictions and media regulation. 
 So it does not only occur in countries where we already knew there have been violations, but also in unexpected places such as Italy, where pluralism of information is being threatened", said Soria Blatmann, who is responsible for Europe at RWB.The report notes that the situation is particularly bad in Asia and that no Arab state is ranked among the top 50. 
 He also pledged that a detailed government programme for the next four years will be presented to parliament and the public, and outlined key areas of focus for the cabinet. They include fighting organised crime and corruption, reducing poverty, increasing employment opportunities and carrying out reforms in education, health and public administration. 
 Yugoslav director Goran Paskaljevic's 1998 black comedy  Bure baruta  (Powder Keg), had the full cinema shrieking with laughter when one unhinged Belgrader, enraged over a city bus driver's endless Balkan coffee break, steals the bus for a wild ride."Conflict is not always black," Milanovic-Blank said. 
 If the results stand, AKP will have won over 34 per cent of the vote and more than 360 seats in the country's 550-member parliament - an absolute majority. Seeking to dispel concerns that its Islamic roots could pose a threat to Turkey's secularist foundations, AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the party would not seek to change anyone's lifestyle and that the country would continue on its traditionally pro-Western path. He also pledged that AKP would advance Turkey's EU accession agenda and implement an IMF-backed economic programme, though he added that changes might have to be made. The only other party likely to gain parliamentary representation is Deniz Baykal's Republican People's Party (CHP), which won over 19 per cent of the vote. 
 The CHP is the oldest political party in the country and was founded by the father of the Turkish secularist state, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in 1923.None of the remaining 16 parties appears to have met the ten per cent threshold required to enter parliament. 
 In March 1994, Erdogan was elected to a four-year term as mayor of Istanbul as the candidate of the Welfare party. Erdogan is ineligible to become Prime Minister because of a 1999 conviction for inciting religious hatred, and the Constitutional Court is still mulling over a request by Turkey's chief prosecutor to ban AKP due to legal violations. Under Turkey's constitution, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer is to designate the new prime minister, but AKP insists it will decide on the issue. The party has so far managed to avoid angering Turkey's powerful military. 
 Now a new project is helping former military personnel transition to civilian careers.  By Emil Tsenkov in Sofia for Balkan Times -- 05/11/02 Georgi Chervenakov's background is a military one, but - as with many other Bulgarian officers - his military career is history. 
 It now has 39 out of 75 seats in parliament. Still unclear is who would replace Djukanovic as the DPS candidate for president. 
 His view was supported by Steiner who said that the final status of the Serbian province should be determined by the UN Security Council. Donors endorsed the economic priorities outlined in the government's programme, including fostering economic development and growth, and increasing employment; improving the living standards of vulnerable groups and the access to better quality education and healthcare; ensuring an efficient and transparent public administration; and providing equal opportunities for all citizens, while supporting refugee and IDP returns. Although the meeting did not aim to collect new pledges, donors estimated that an additional 450m euros would be required to finance Kosovo's public investment programme between 2003 and 2005 and 50m euros are needed for general budget support. 
 Speedier reforms would allow it to catch up with Bulgaria and Romania, which are aiming for EU membership in 2007, he said. Kostunica, however, has often criticised Djindjic's reform policies, advocating a more moderate approach. Djindjic's statement followed an agreement between the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition and Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), ending five months of political impasse and allowing DSS deputies to resume their parliamentary seats. 
 With 34.2 per cent of the vote, according to preliminary election results, AKP will field 363 deputies in the new 550-seat parliament. 
 The remaining nine seats will go to independent candidates. Erdogan and Baykal have agreed to work together to advance the country's EU accession bid, a move Turkey's president has welcomed. Following the meeting with Sezer, Erdogan said: "We discussed the steps we're taking during the European Union process. 
 Reaching a compromise with Athens on the Cyprus issue would be a positive step in itself. 
 European officials have also hinted that with an untested party with deep roots in banned Islamic movements now at the helm in Turkey, the EU will first want to see its capacity to implement reforms before giving the green light for talks. 
 However, he noted that the public is not yet noticing any concrete improvement in their standard of living."There are good grounds for real growth in the private sector and now is the time to invest in Yugoslavia," Montgomery said. Ross Connelly, a representative of the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation, said that successful implementation of economic reforms in Serbia would encourage US investment."Serbia lies at the centre of the Southeast Europe free trade zone, which is a dynamic market with an upward trend, a population of around 60 million in eight countries, and a market which has much to offer to US investors," he said at the closing of the conference, which attracted 40 US companies, including Citibank, DHL, Eli Lilly, Motorola, Oracle, Philip Morris, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Scarsdale-Harrison, AbCRO, Double D Tractor and PAIR. 
  IOC Upbeat on Athens Preparations for 2004 Olympics  27/11/2002 Athens is making good progress in preparations for the summer Olympics in 2004, International Olympic Committee inspectors said. 
 But they also thought the pace of preparations should not falter if all projects related to the games were to be completed on time.  (AFP, Reuters, Times Online - 09/11/02; AP - 08/11/02; CNN - 06/11/02)Athens is making good progress in preparations for the summer Olympics in 2004, International Olympic Committee (IOC) inspectors said last month at the end of a three-day visit to the Greek capital. 
 But they also thought the pace of preparations should not falter if all projects related to the games were to be completed on time."I am very pleased to report that Athens is really taking Olympic shape," Denis Oswald, chief IOC inspector said 8 November. 
 "Significant progress has been achieved in several areas and our commission has been favourably impressed by what we have seen."Oswald, heading a team of about 40 IOC officials, visited Athens to assess the progress in all key aspects of the 2004 Olympics. 
 The mission's findings were far more positive than those in the report of former IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch more than two years ago, when he warned that Greece could lose the Olympics due to the slow progress. Bur the IOC inspectors commended the Athens Olympics Committee organisers (ATHOC) for advancing the projects in the areas of road infrastructure and public transportation, as well as in the construction of some of the venues for the games. According to ATHOC Chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the IOC's requirement for 20,000 luxury rooms to accommodate IOC members and VIPs has also been met. 
 Some 15,000 competitors and officials, 20,000 media representatives and hundreds of thousands of other visitors are expected to arrive in Athens for the summer Olympics, from 13 August to 29 August 2004.However some projects will require stronger efforts on the part of the organisers and the government to be completed on time."The schedule will be tight until the end. 
 It's very crucial that (Athens organisers) and the government keep the pace they had at the moment in order to be ready on time," Oswald said, warning about a "number of critical areas". 
 Among them were an indoor basketball venue, football venues and the construction of a modern dome of glass and steel at the main stadium for the games. Delays in the implementation of a project by acclaimed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava to erect an original, but complex, glass-and-steel dome at the main venue of the games, the Athens Olympic stadium, could prove a serious threat to the project and lead to its demise altogether. 
 He pointed out that in spite of CAFAO giving BiH a new computer system for customs collection and providing training for customs officers, the revenue losses continue."So the basic tool is there but it doesn't work," he said. 
 The executive director and the entire managing board were also fired as authorities uncovered and halted the unauthorised export of spare parts for armoured personnel carriers, which were misrepresented as civilian products meant for tractors. 
 The recipient was a company based in Syria."We have prevented Bulgaria from being involved in an international scandal of breaking embargoes on arms trade with risky countries," a government statement said, adding that it had prevented the export of all the components, making it impossible for the end recipient to assemble useable products. On 10 October, Terem director Plamen Petrov signed a contract with Mihail Georgiev, of the Washington-registered Rodeos Investment, for export of the components. 
 The final recipient has been identified as Al-Karnak, based in Bab Alhala, Syria - one of seven countries on Washington's list of state sponsors of terrorism. Officials say the deal was authorised by Terem's CEO, Vlado Vladov, and executed with the complicity of the deputy director for finance, Kichka Yankova. 
 He said Pardew expressed Washington's recognition of Sofia's prompt reaction. 
 Economic reform and development of the needed administrative and judicial capacity are the focal areas. The roadmaps are individual and take into account each country's achievements, notes Bulgarian Minister of European Affairs Meglena Kuneva. 
 However, this assistance would be conditional on each country's progress in line with their roadmaps and on their capacity to manage and use funds effectively. Noting that both Bulgaria and Romania have begun to develop capacities for better use of existing funds, the EC said in its statement that if preparations are continued and intensified, the two would be ready to receive and use additional funds effectively from 2004 onwards. Meanwhile, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said his government plans to wrap up negotiations on the Energy chapter of the EU accession process on Monday (18 November). 
 Both have been acting as virtual members of the 19-nation alliance, offering access to strategic airstrips and naval bases on the Black Sea, as well as contributing troops to the international force in Afghanistan."Initially, I shared the scepticism about admitting such a large group," said Sen Joseph Biden, chairman of the US Senate's Foreign Relations Committee. 
 He added there was a need to redouble efforts to ensure that "the blessings of progress" reach everyone in the province. While in Kosovo, the UN chief met with international and local officials, including President Ibrahim Rugova, Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, Parliamentary Speaker Nexhat Daci and Kosovo Serb politicians. After a visit to the ethnically divided northern town of Mitrovica and several villages, Annan noted that, although the situation still appeared difficult, there were signs of progress. 
 Annan is to meet UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte in Belgrade on Wednesday. Another issue was Yugoslavia's participation in peacekeeping operations. 
 He also said it marked the beginning of an "even more difficult and responsible stage" of full political, economic and military adaptation, continued development of democracy and the market economy, and greater responsibility for the stability and security of Southeast Europe and the entire Euro-Atlantic area. Romania's Iliescu, meanwhile, said his country is "determined to continue to engage with full responsibility, energy and resources in the effort of preparations for full integration into the alliance."The two countries are considered strategically important for their geographic location on the Black Sea and as a bulwark in the fight against terrorism. 
 The free world faces a "deadly cocktail of threats," NATO Secretary General George Robertson said, including "terrorists and their backers, failed states in which they flourish, and proliferating weapons of mass destruction".The heads of state agreed to create a NATO Response Force, composed of a technologically advanced, flexible, deployable, interoperable and sustainable force for land, sea and air operations. 
 The party, established in 2001 by former members of an outlawed Islamic party, won a landslide victory in the 3 November parliamentary elections, paving the way for the first single-party government in Turkey in more than a decade. The broad constitutional reforms the government is planning to carry out are aimed at meeting the EU's set of political criteria -- known as the Copenhagen criteria -- thus improving Turkey's chances for EU membership. 
  World Bank Offers Hope for Porto Romano Cleanup  09/12/2002 Thousands of Albanians face an environmental disaster in Porto Romano, near the port city of Durres. 
 Now the World Bank is helping to clean up an area described by the UN Environment Programme as the worst "hot spot" in the Balkans.  By Alban Bala for Balkan Times in Tirana - 09/12/02 Porto Romano sits on a former marsh inhabited by more than 3,000 people, most of whom came to this village from the poorer north of the country after the fall of communism in 1992. 
 A year ago, the neighborhood was declared "a disaster area" by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).An elementary school is situated only 100 meters from the refuse of a chemical plant that once produced pesticides -- such as lindane, a nerve poison and carcinogen -- and sodium dichromate for leather tanning. 
  "Yugo-America" Project Reprised  13/12/2002 After 20 years, a small Serbian car is poised to re-enter American markets.  By Dusan Kosanovic for Balkan Times in Belgrade - 12/12/02 In the mid 1980s, the communist regime in Yugoslavia announced the "work of the century" -- exporting the Yugo to America. 
 Zastava, a company based in the industrial city of Kragujevac, manufactured the car. 
 The Yugo's quality was poor compared to other cars in the same price bracket. 
 Attempts to find a suitable buyer for Zastava have foundered. Under the terms of a tentative deal reached in early October, a New Jersey company -- Nucarco, Inc. -- plans a joint venture with Zastava under the name Zastava Motor Works (ZMW). 
 Nucarco would own 80 per cent, Zastava, the rest. 
 The American partner would invest $150m over the next three years, while Zastava would provide know-how, technology, real estate and labour. Nucarco has also promised to improve the emissions levels of the vehicles, meeting European and US standards. 
 Many experts have said that Zastava's previous attempt failed not because its cars were impractical, but because of low quality and poor marketing. 
 The joint venture hopes to revive the troubled car factory in Kragujevac, and aims to break into US, South American and Asian markets with a well-advertised low price. Promising as all this may sound, the venture has nevertheless run into political problems in Serbia. 
 Representatives of the Democratic Party of Serbia have sharply criticised the business proposal, charging that Nucarco founder Malcolm Bricklin is untrustworthy and more interested in sales than in vehicle production. 
 In an interview for the Belgrade daily  Blic , Zastava's legal representative, Miodrag Savicevic, said the agreement is not yet final. 
 In his capacity of economy minister, he is supervising the sale. Bulgartabak's sale attracted four offers. 
  SERDA Helping Foreign, Local Investors Do Business Around Sarajevo  04/12/2002 The Sarajevo Economic Region Development Agency (SERDA) is helping both foreign and local investors here by providing contacts, locations and information about getting credits from banks.  By Beth Kampschror for Balkan Times in Sarajevo - 03/12/02 An agency that provides help for businesses in the Sarajevo area proved to be invaluable for an American company searching for a factory location here, according to the company's general manager."The Sarajevo Economic Region Development Agency (SERDA) was able to provide us a lot of contacts in the Sarajevo area when we were first looking for locations to place our factory, and introduced us to a number of individuals in the private sector and a number of government officials," said IBD General Manager Heath Cox. In March, the concrete block manufacturing company plans to open a factory in Sarajevo, its second in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
 The other organisers were Alpha Research, a marketing and social research agency, and bTV television channel. Deliberative Polling is a technique incorporating deliberation in small group discussions with scientific random sampling to provide public consultation on public policy and electoral issues. 
 It was developed by Professor James Fishkin of the University of Texas at Austin in 1988.The Bulgarian Deliberative Poll brought together 281 deliberators selected from a representative sample of about 1,200 randomly chosen participants in a pre-deliberation baseline survey on various crime-related issues. 
 A significant number of experts holding key positions in the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary participated in the three panels of the Deliberative Poll: Crime and Punishment, Crime and Society and direct dialogue. Members of the selected sample group received carefully balanced and publicly available briefing materials. 
 After deliberation, 46 per cent held that opinion. Every thesis was presented with arguments supporting or opposing it, so participants could compare the different positions, Alpha Research head Boryana Dimitrova explained. 
 She added that before deliberation, 73 per cent of the respondents believed politicians didn't care about what they thought. 
 Soldiers have trained at a fighting simulation centre using US software, have taken various courses at the professional development centre and have received telecommunications and artillery training. Since 1996, the US government has donated 45 battle tanks, 85 armoured personnel carriers, 15 helicopters and 116 howitzers to the Federation."We've taken over some technology, mainly of American origin. 
 Piperovic has denied the charges. The arrests came after a Moldovan woman, a mother of two who had come to Montenegro in search of a job, sought police protection. 
 Two weeks ago, he was allowed to contact his family, SFOR said. Nikola Slavuljica, a police spokesman in Tuzla, told AFP in late October that during the 1992-1995 war, Fijuljanin had lived in Bocinja, a village in the country's north inhabited at the time by fighters from Islamic countries. 
  Washington Plans to Upgrade Turkish Military Bases  05/12/2002 The United States will hold discussions with Turkey on investing up to several hundred million dollars in military bases that could be used in a war with Iraq, US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said after talks with officials in Ankara.  (AFP, FT - 05/12/02; AP, Reuters, BBC, CNN, MSNBC, RFE/RL - 04/12/02)The United States will hold discussions with Turkey on upgrading military bases that could be used in the event of a war with Iraq, US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Wednesday (4 December) after two days of talks with officials in Ankara."We are talking potentially about tens of millions, probably several hundred million dollars of investment in several facilities that we might use," Wolfowitz said. 
 Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah Gul said the government has not reached a final political decision and that any agreement on supporting action against Iraq would have to be approved by parliament. Meanwhile, Wolfowitz said US President George W Bush has invited the leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to talks in Washington. 
 Erdogan would be the first AKP official to visit Washington since the party came to power last month."There are many issues to discuss with him," Wolfowitz said. 
 "We want to continue not only with the military planning level talks but with the higher level political talks on Iraq."Washington has also reiterated its support for Turkey's hopes of joining the EU. 
 The two sides are expected to sign the agreement 10 December, five days before the mandate of a UN observer mission is due to end. The peninsula is located on the Adriatic, some 45 km southeast of the Croatian city of Dubrovnik, and controls access to Yugoslavia's naval base at Kotor Bay. 
  Bush Reassures Erdogan of Washington's Support for Turkey's EU Bid  11/12/2002 US President George W. Bush met with Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (10 December) and reiterated Washington's support for Turkey's EU bid.  (AFP, FT, The Washington Post - 11/12/02; AP, Reuters, VOA, Anadolu Agency - 10/12/02)After meeting with Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, US President George W. Bush expressed Washington's support for Turkey's EU bid. 
 Speaking Monday night at Washington's Centre for Strategic and International Studies, he said Turkey's preference was for war "to be the last resort." 
 As a sign of improving relations, the Yugoslav national carrier JAT is due to resume regular direct flights to Tirana within days, after a break of more than two decades. While in Moscow, Meta met with a 28-member business delegation. 
 Accords were signed on increased university exchanges and on co-operation between the Russian and Albanian chambers of commerce. Intensifying contacts between businessmen and business organisations "will help us develop relations between our countries," said Moscow Chamber of Commerce head and former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. 
 The decision is the first to grant limited immunity to journalists working in combat zones and is expected to set a precedent for other ad hoc courts and the new International Criminal Court. Wednesday's (11 December) ruling came in response to an appeal filed last May by  The Washington Post  and its reporter Jonathan Randal, who was subpoenaed to testify in the trial against ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Brdjanin. On 11 February 1993, the  Post  carried an article by Randal quoting Brdjanin as supporting the expulsion of non-Serbs from Banja Luka. 
 According to Plavsic, her only condition was not to testify at other trials. Among the witnesses expected to appear during the final hearing are former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the former UN envoy to the Balkans, Carl Bildt. Former Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Milorad Dodik is expected to testify for the defence. 
  Plavsic Asks UN Tribunal for Justice  18/12/2002 Addressing the UN war crimes tribunal, former Bosnian Serb leader Biljana Plavsic admitted responsibility for the persecution of non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  (Reuters, The Independent, The Washington Post - 18/12/02; AP, BBC, CNN, Reuters, The New York Times, VOA, RFE/RL, Radio B92 - 17/12/02)Addressing the UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (17 December), former Bosnian Serb leader Biljana Plavsic admitted responsibility for the persecution of non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and appealed for justice."You must strive in your judgment to find whatever justice this world can offer, not only for me, but also for the innocent victims of this war," Plavsic told the three-judge panel presiding at her three-day sentencing hearing. She said that over time she had come to realise that "many thousands of innocent people were the victims of organised, systematic efforts to remove Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats from territory claimed by Serbs." 
 But she also credited Plavsic with taking a personal risk in breaking with other hard-line nationalists and supporting the Dayton peace agreement, and expressed respect for the Plavsic's admission of guilt and willingness to take responsibility. The judges also heard testimony from the international community's former High Representative, Carl Bildt, who praised Plavsic for her contribution to implementing the Dayton accord. 
 Papandreou, in Brussels to launch his country's turn at the six-month rotating presidency, also said Greece would work towards building a stronger international presence for the EU.The accession treaty inviting ten Central and East European countries -- Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia -- to join the Union in 2004 will be signed on 16 April in Athens. 
 Papandreou said Athens would also focus on advancing the accession strategies of Bulgaria and Romania "so that they can become members within the regular timetable and to make progress with a new partnership with Turkey."In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said he believed Croatia could also make a swift progress on its accession course. 
 "It is clear that the constitutional amendment is subjective, concrete and aimed at one individual," the president said. But the Turkish presidential office carries limited powers, which will not allow Sezer to veto the legislation again. If Sezer backs off and signs the contested law, Erdogan would be able to stand in a by-election in the southeast province of Siirt early next year, become a member of parliament in February and then replace Gul as prime minister. 
  Del Ponte Criticises Belgrade, Wants Outgoing Serbian President in The Hague  23/12/2002 UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has again criticised Yugoslav authorities for unsatisfactory co-operation with the international criminal tribunal in The Hague.  (AP, Reuters, ICTY - 20/12/02; UN -- 18/12/02 - 20/12/02; Radio B92 - 19/12/02 -22/12/02)UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Yugoslav authorities on Friday (20 December) for unsatisfactory co-operation with the international criminal tribunal in The Hague. 
 She said the strategy is backed up by the authority of the Office of the High Representative, which can dismiss mayors or housing authority officials who are blocking the process. Property law implementation steadily increased over the summer in BiH as a whole, according to UNHCR figures. 
 Zecevic said that the increase was a reflection of this year's record return figures and of the authorities realising that they had to evict illegal occupants during the summer reconstruction season."It's this reconstruction season that had a certain impact on them taking it seriously. 
 Djindjic said the law was quite clear and no exceptions would be made. A week ago, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Belgrade for unsatisfactory co-operation with the tribunal. 
 The estimated cost of the entire decommissioning process will be over $400m. The Kozloduy plant, located some 200 km north of Sofia, accounts for about 45 per cent of Bulgaria's electricity output. 
 Units 1 and 2 were last upgraded in 1999, when Bulgaria signed a memorandum with the EU agreeing to their closure by the end of 2002."Bulgaria will still be a leading exporter of electricity in the region after the closure of units 1 and 2 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. 
 Opportunities to export between 5.5 billion and 6 billion kWh of electricity are conceivable in 2003", said Energy Minister Milko Kovachev, following the government's decision on 19 December to start the decommissioning process. A government forecasting agency said these prospects would remain unchanged until 2008 or even -- under certain circumstances -- until 2020. 
 After receiving the incoming call over Vsat, ISPs passed the signal on over local telephone lines. 
 There could be great gains if Southeast Europe has a common electricity network, rather than the current jumble of incompatible connections, or an integrated financial framework. 
 Now it has become one of the most loyal supporters of Washington and NATO in the Balkans, and is set to join the alliance in two years' time.  By Galina Michailova for Southeast European Times in Sofia - 23/01/03 Ex-communist Bulgaria, the Soviet Union's staunchest ally during the Cold War era, has become one of the most loyal supporters of Washington and NATO in the Balkans and is now set to become a member of the Western pact. In November, Bulgaria was one of seven East European states invited to join NATO. 
 It is scheduled to join in 2004, when the ratification process is completed. The country, once dubbed the 16th Soviet Republic due to its close ties with Moscow, has said it would allow the United States to use a Black Sea air base in the event of an attack against Iraq. But the road from 45 years of totalitarian rule -- during which the West was the enemy -- to becoming a US partner and future NATO member was not easy. 
 To that end, Bulgaria allowed the United States to use its Sarafovo military base on the Black Sea during the war in Afghanistan, starting in late 2001.Although Bulgaria must do more to reform its armed forces and judicial system, cut red tape and fight corruption, the country is on its way to joining NATO. 
  Yugoslav Armed Forces Reform  02/01/2003 International officials are welcoming Yugoslavia's overhaul of its military, but warn that fuller co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains a pressing issue as the country seeks to join Euro-Atlantic integration processes.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 02/01/03 Yugoslav authorities must carry out a detailed reform of the country's armed forces, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said during a meeting held in Belgrade in November. 
 The EUPM will answer to Paddy Ashdown, the international community's high representative in BiH.The mission will operate on a 38m-euro annual budget as it carries out the supervision and training of Bosnian police forces. 
 "If this spirit prevails we are very optimistic that a solution can be reached by 28 February ",  The Guardian  quoted government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou as saying. How other Turkish political parties and the country's influential military reacted to Erdogan's statement was not immediately clear."What Erdogan said indicates a change in attitudes in Turkey about Cyprus", Huseyin Bagci, professor of international relations at Ankara's Middle East Technical University, was quoted by AP as saying. 
 "They're out of this world."But Janica Kostelic was more down to earth as she won her fifth World Cup victory this season and her 18th overall. 
 She now has 1055 points in the overall standings, with a comfortable margin between her and Italy's Karen Putzer, who ranks second with 569 points."There was nothing to it," said Kostelic, who won three gold medals and one silver in the Salt Lake City Olympics last year only months after a serious knee injury. 
  Free Medical Clinic for Kosovo Village  08/01/2003 Over 100 villagers from Debelde, near Kosovo's border with Macedonia, received medical and dental treatment during a free clinic on Sunday (5 January). 
 The majority of patients were elderly people and children.  (KFOR - 07/01/03)Over 100 villagers from Debelde, near Kosovo's border with Macedonia, received medical and dental treatment during a free clinic on Sunday (5 January). 
 The programme aims to bring basic medical and dental care to remote villages like Debelde. 
 Medical professionals received 115 patients from the village, which is situated on a ridgeline along the Haj Ducki Put Mountain Range in eastern Kosovo. 
 Interpreters helped the patients communicate their complaints and concerns and translated physician instructions. The dental team saw 18 villagers and had to extract a lot of teeth -- a clear sign of poor preventive care in this remote area. 
 He promised a referendum on independence and said economic progress, minority rights and fighting organised crime would be among his government's priorities.  (Beta - 09/01/03; AP, Tanjug, Radio B92 - 08/01/03)Montenegro's 75-seat parliament elected former president and Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) leader Milo Djukanovic as prime minister on Wednesday (8 January). 
 The month-long exercise, code-named Rapid Guardian 2003, aims to train and enhance the capabilities of NATO reserve forces to carry out peacekeeping operations in this region. 
  Olympic Torch Unveiled in Athens  17/01/2003 At a special event in Athens on Wednesday (15 January), International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge and the chief organiser of the 2004 Summer Games, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, unveiled the Olympic torch.  (VOA, AP, AFP, Official Web Site of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games - 15/01/03)At a special event in Athens on Wednesday (15 January), International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge and the chief organiser of the 2004 Summer Games, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, unveiled the Olympic torch. Inspired by the olive leaf, the two-toned 68-centimetre torch is made of olive wood and magnesium and weighs 700 grams. 
 The flame does not simply belong to the torch but rises as an extension of the torch-bearer's hand, according to a description on the Athens 2004 Olympics website."The torch is fantastic. 
 The design is wonderful, very pure lines, and also takes the inspiration from the olive tree, which is so symbolic for the Olympic Games and for Greece," said Denis Oswald, head of the IOC co-ordination team for Athens. Besides being a global symbol of peace and freedom, the olive tree has been one of Greece's most powerful symbols since ancient times."It perfectly features the image of contemporary Greece. 
 We were inspired by the way this torch will reflect the spirit of Greece along with the values of peace and hope to every place it travels," Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said. As one of the main symbols of every Olympics, the torch of the Athens 2004 Olympics is also in harmony with the emblem of the Games -- a circular wreath made of an olive branch."I tried to incorporate in the torch as many elements of Greek civilisation as possible, aiming through it to develop a dialogue among people, which is the basic objective of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Idea," said Varotsos. In a prelude to the Games, the torch will -- for the first time in history -- cross all five continents during a several-month relay in 2004. 
 The journey begins in Olympia, a small village in the Peloponnese where the Olympics were held in ancient times. 
 The Russian and Bulgarian foreign ministers are scheduled to meet before the end of January. While in Moscow, Parvanov attended a special ceremony hosted by the International Fund for Unity of Orthodox Peoples and received its annual award for 2002, honouring his "outstanding efforts to consolidate unity between Orthodox peoples."The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II, praised Parvanov's efforts towards the reunification of Bulgaria's split Orthodox Church, citing a law adopted by parliament last December that aims to end the schism."I accept this prize as president of a country where religious rights and the equality of Christians, Muslims, Jews and others are guaranteed by the Constitution and other laws and, more importantly, are a fact of life," the Bulgarian leader said during the ceremony. Parvanov said he would donate the $20,000 accompanying the award to two schools in southern Bulgaria and towards the establishment of an annual student achievement award at the University of Sofia, among other initiatives. 
  The Council of Europe's Role in Integrating Southeast Europe  27/01/2003 With current public attention in Southeast Europe firmly focused on EU enlargement, it is easy to underestimate the relatively low-key efforts of the Council of Europe to bring together all nations in the continent and beyond.  By Emil Tsenkov for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 27/01/03 While Turkey is knocking on the EU's door, the Western Balkans are engaged in the EU Stabilisation and Association process, and Bulgaria and Romania have recently become eligible for EU membership in 2007, almost all of these countries have seats at Europe's Palace - the Strasbourg-based headquarters of the oldest intergovernmental pan-European structure. 
 Believing the UN tribunal is biased against Serbs, Kostunica has been reluctant to increase Belgrade's co-operation with The Hague. Svilanovic, who also chairs his country's council on co-operation with the UN tribunal, is said to have called on visiting US envoy for war crimes, Pierre-Richard Prosper, last week for Washington's assistance in apprehending Mladic. The United States has given Belgrade until the end of March to step up co-operation with The Hague. 
 The two other indictees, he said, were thought to be hiding in Serbia. Two days before Svilanovic's interview, Djindjic called on Washington and the international community to ease pressure on Belgrade on issues relating to its co-operation with The Hague tribunal. 
 He also praised Croatia for its efforts towards enhancing regional co-operation. As part of his effort to ensure individual EU member support for Croatia's bid, Racan will be visiting Athens, Rome and Vienna. 
 The tremor, which was also felt in the nearby provinces of Sivas, Erzincan and Erzurum, damaged houses in at least five villages."I think there is great damage in the villages," Turkish Public Works Minister Zeki Ergezen said as he flew off to Elazig, a regional centre. 
 The effects could be quite devastating," he added. The only fatality -- a 65-year-old woman from the village of Saglamtas, near Pulumur -- was killed when her home collapsed. According to Istanbul-based Kandilli Seismology Centre, the earthquake hit Pulumur at 7:25 am local time, and was followed by three aftershocks of 3.1 on the Richter scale, also felt in the surrounding area. 
 Three more people in the Erzincan province were injured under similar circumstances. Early reports quoted Pulumur Mayor Mesut Coskun as saying the earthquake had damaged several buildings and that there was an urgent need for tents, as people were too scared to go back to their homes despite the low temperatures. 
 Omisalj is also the final point of another pipeline, the Druzhba-Adria linking the Russian oilfields with the Adriatic, whose capacity is up to 300,000 barrels per day. Addressing local environmental groups' concerns about possible oil spills and environmental damage to the Adriatic coast -- Croatia's main source of tourism revenue -- Racan assured that both projects would be implemented in compliance with environmental standards. 
  Bulgaria Launches "Coming Home" Project  05/02/2003 The return of highly-skilled and well-educated emigrants could play a crucial role in paving Bulgaria's future. A national career guidance programme aims to provide the kind of information that young professionals need when considering a return home.  By Svetla Dimitrova for Southeast European Times in Sofia - 04/02/03 Over the past 12 years, between 300,000 and 900,000 people are estimated to have left Bulgaria for Western Europe and North America. 
 Many of these highly-skilled and well-educated emigrants have proven successful in their professional careers. 
 But few are likely to make that decision without being clear about employment opportunities back home. Taking this into account, the Ministry of Economy, the government's Agency for Bulgarians Abroad (ABA) and JobTiger OOD launched the Coming Home project on 21 January as part of a national career guidance programme they initiated last year. 
 By using a professional and systematic approach, the best comprehensive job bank and interactive information tools, and the most advanced technology, the three project co-ordinating institutions hope to draw more young Bulgarians back home. Two of the three signatories of the project agreement, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Nikolay Vassilev and ABA head Anton Piralkov, are themselves among the number of Bulgarian professionals who left a successful career abroad to return home. 
 The majority of Vassilev's advisors also had well-established careers before returning to Bulgaria. 
 Some estimate that criminal groups have smuggled between 6,000 and 10,000 foreign women into BiH, many of whom are working in nightclubs against their will. But because thwarting this trade is linked to stopping other international crime -- such as illegal border crossings and smuggling -- and to improving police investigations and co-operation among BiH's 14 separate police forces, it made sense to continue the anti-trafficking work with a new programme, said EUPM spokesman Jon Oskar Solnes."FIGHT [Fight and Intervention Against Human Trafficking] is complementary to the long-term strategy, which is to gather intelligence on the criminals who are doing this, and you do that by enhancing police capacity," he said, adding that improving surveillance and forensics techniques were some of the general EUPM goals. The EUPM has assumed a monitoring role since taking over from the UN's 1,600-strong international police force on 1 January. 
 As part of a 13-member international expedition composed mostly of Bulgarian and Spanish experts from various fields, he traveled by plane from Sofia to Milan and from Milan to Buenos Aires, and later by ship from Ushuaia to Livingston Island at the South Pole. Dr Ugrinovski's primary mission was to provide healthcare to members in the expedition, to examine the effects of severe living conditions on the heart and blood circulation, and, as a personal goal, to examine human behaviour after long periods of isolation in extreme conditions. 
 It also opened the door for other Macedonian scientists to take part in international missions at the South Pole as members of the Polar Research Centre that he recently created in the main University in Skopje -- "Kiril i Metodij".Ugrinovski's two-and-a-half-month expedition began in November and ended in January. 
 All members of the expedition stayed and worked at the research base at Livingston Island. 
 But it's not exactly night because there is daylight all the time, " Ugrinovski explained. He conveyed pride in being the first Macedonian selected by the European Board for Polar Research to take part in the expedition and the first Macedonian to spend an extended period of time in the Antarctic. 
 Few people, radio contact only once a week, penguins and a few other birds, the ocean, snow and ice -- that's the Antarctic. 
 However, according to the most recent research conducted by the Centre for Democracy (CEDEM), an NGO in Podgorica, only 46.3 per cent of eligible voters will head to the polls Sunday (9 February). 
 In addition, surveys suggest that the public doubts the new government will carry out promised reforms. 
 By law, should an election fail, presidential duties are to be carried out by the parliament speaker -- none other than Vujanovic himself. 
 It conducted a large-scale campaign accusing the former president and his family of crime and corruption. Soon after his father's fall from power, Marko fled the country. 
 Staff of the Yugoslav Embassy in Moscow are said to have checked an address in the Russian capital that Marko's lawyers have given the court, but the information proved to be false. During his father's rule, Marko managed to amass a great personal fortune through various business ventures. 
  Ten East European Countries Back US Position on Iraq  07/02/2003 Following US Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation before the UN Security Council, ten East European countries -- once members of the communist bloc -- declared unequivocal support for Washington's stand on Iraq.  (International Herald Tribune, Electronic Telegraph, Times Online, CNN, AFP - 06/02/03; AP, Reuters, BBC, UN News Service - 05/02/03)Ten East European countries issued a strongly worded statement following US Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation before the UN Security Council on Wednesday (5 February). 
 Last week, EU members Britain, Denmark, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- along with EU invitees Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic -- published a letter expressing their support for Washington's stand on Iraq. 
 Returning from Washington on Saturday, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova and Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi said the time was not right for parliament to make such a move, but added that they would continue supporting independence. Last week, 42 members of Kosovo's 120-seat parliament backed a motion calling for the adoption of a declaration of independence. 
 Jobs, security and multiethnicity," he said. 
 Most of its supporters followed suit and did not go to the polls. The prospect of an indefinite repetition of elections "carries the risk of protracted political instability," Vulchanov warned. 
 Croatian media sources report that Prime Minister Ivica Racan's visit to Athens has been rescheduled for 21 February and that the application will be submitted then. 
 Parliament acted on a call by President Ion Iliescu earlier this week, following Washington's request for support in a possible military intervention against Iraq. According to the Rompres news agency, the troops will include a 70-strong defence unit, a military police platoon of 25, a medical detachment of 30, an engineering detachment of 149, and four staff officers to serve on the coalition's command unit. Romania is among seven former communist countries invited to join NATO and one of the ten Eastern European countries that recently declared support for US efforts to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. 
 The measure is the first step in the process of implementing the Constitutional Charter, which marked the end of Yugoslavia and the establishment of a loose union of its two constituent republics. Under the accompanying law on implementation of the charter, each republic's parliament is to adopt its own laws on the indirect election of members of the union's joint parliament."I am greatly encouraged by the fact that this significant process began today," Dragoljub Micunovic, speaker of the outgoing Yugoslav Parliament said Thursday. The implementation law obliges the Yugoslav president to call indirect elections for the union's new parliament within five days of adoption of the law on the electing members. Members of the new 126-seat parliament will be appointed directly. 
 Serbia will hold 91 seats, Montenegro the remaining 35.The law adopted by Serbia's Parliament provides that its MPs are to be elected from parties currently represented in the republic's assembly. 
 Of the remaining seats, 14 will go to the pro-Belgrade coalition Together for Change, led by the Socialist People's Party. 
 The two other seats will be shared by the Liberal Alliance and the Coalition of Albanian Parties. Belgrade-based Radio B92, however, quoted representatives of the Democratic Union of Albanians and the Democratic Alliance of Albanians in Montenegro as saying they would not send a deputy to the new parliament, to protest the constitutional charter preamble describing Kosovo as part of Serbia. Also in Belgrade, the head of the OSCE mission to Serbia-Montenegro, Ambassador Maurizio Massari, presented the OSCE's plan of action to assist the newly constituted union on Thursday."One of our priorities is to assist this process through expertise so that the republics of Serbia and Montenegro are furnished with the best possible constitutional mechanisms, given the socio-political environments in both republics," Massari said. The main focus of the plan, drawn up after consultations with a broad range of players across the political spectrum in both Serbia and Montenegro, is on constitutional assistance and ongoing programme activities. 
 NATO Secretary General George Robertson said members of the Alliance's Defence Planning Committee (DPC) had unanimously agreed on the substance, timing and steps for integrating the bloc's collective solidarity with Turkey."The 18 NATO allies -- members of the integrated military structure -- agreed today to task military planners to begin their work and advice on preventive deployment of AWACS airplanes, NATO support for deployment of theatre missile defences of Turkey, and support for allied chemical and biological defence capabilities," Robertson said late Sunday. 
 Turkish officials said Ankara could do nothing more to prevent a military strike unless Saddam Hussein co-operates. Also Sunday, five US Air Force cargo planes arrived in Turkey's military base near Diyarbakir. 
  Iron Church in Istanbul Slipping Towards the Sea  17/02/2003 St Stephan Bulgarian Church in the middle of Istanbul is on the move. 
 The century-old church is gradually sliding towards the sea and unless restoration begins soon, a unique piece of the world's architectural heritage will be lost.  By Vahit Bora for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 17/02/03 Istanbul is not only the city where two continents meet, but also a place where different civilisations gather. 
 The city is surrounded by unique masterpieces of both Islamic and Christian architecture. 
 But the church, a landmark in Bulgarian history, requires special care. The church was established early in the 20th century. 
 Parts of the church were loaded onto a ship which travelled down the Danube to the Black Sea and finally to Istanbul. 
 Besides being left in solitude, the church has another serious problem. Professor Mete Tapan from Istanbul Technical University and architect Hasan Kuruyaz?c? assert that the building is sliding towards the sea due to spaces left in the ground. 
 As a result, the historic church is creeping further towards the sea each day. 
  Micic Seeks End to Political Impasse, Encourage More Participation by Women  21/02/2003 Natasa Micic assumed the role of caretaker president of Serbia on 29 December 2002, becoming the first female head of state in Serbian history. 
 The country was also among the first to indicate its willingness to make its land, seaports and air available to the international coalition against Iraq. Incumbent and opposition political forces have a common attitude when it comes to the United States, seen as a main strategic ally. 
 Haradin Bala, Isak Musliu and Agim Murtezi are the first Kosovo Albanians to be charged by The Hague tribunal for war crimes committed during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo. No casualties were sustained in the operation, which was carried out in co-ordination with UNMIK, a KFOR press release said. 
 Bala, Musliu and Murtezi -- all former members of the disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) -- have been taken to a secure location pending their transfer to The Hague. Praising the KFOR soldiers and officers involved in Monday's operation for their "courage, professionalism and dedication", NATO Secretary General George Robertson described the action as "a significant new step" in the alliance's efforts to crack down on war crimes suspects in the Balkans."This should also send a message that we will act against any person indicted for war crimes, regardless of their ethnicity. 
 Fatmir Limaj was the highest ranking of the four and is alleged to have played a leading role in atrocities committed during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo.  (AFP, Reuters - 19/02/03; AP, Reuters, BBC, VOA, Radio B92 - 18/02/03)UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte confirmed on Tuesday (18 February) that Haradin Balaj, Isak Musliu and Agim Murtezi, who were arrested by KFOR troops a day earlier, have been transferred to The Hague. 
 He spoke after a meeting with chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte.  (VOA, MIA, Makfax, Radio B92 - 19/02/03)Macedonia has promised co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in the investigation of atrocities related to the 2001 conflict in the country. 
 Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte held talks with Macedonian Chief Prosecutor Aleksandar Prcevski on Wednesday (19 February). 
  Djindjic Escapes Alleged Assassination Attempt  24/02/2003 A truck driver with local mafia connections and ties to a Milosevic-era secret police chief nearly crashed his vehicle into a car carrying Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
 Croatia, which hopes to enter the EU in 2007, formally applied for membership.  (EUobserver.com - 24/02/03; The New York Times - 23/02/03; HINA, Reuters, BBC - 21/02/03)On Friday (21 February), Croatia became the first Western Balkan country to formally apply for EU membership, which it hopes to gain in 2007 together with Bulgaria and Romania."Croatia is formalising its strategic goal of becoming an integral part of this new political entity," Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said in Athens as he handed the one-page official application, co-signed by President Stipe Mesic, to his Greek counterpart Costas Simitis. 
  Serbia, Montenegro Elect Members of New Joint Legislature  26/02/2003 The Serbian and the Montenegrin parliaments voted Tuesday to elect the members of the new federal parliament.  (AP, VOA, Radio B92, Serbian Government Website - 25/02/03)The parliaments of Serbia and Montenegro voted Tuesday (25 February) to elect the members of the union's new 126-seat joint legislature. 
 While the majority of the seats have gone to pro-democracy parties and coalitions in both republics, a little less than a third will be taken by hard-line opposition politicians. The Serbian Parliament approved the list of nominees by a vote of 164 to 28 and three abstentions. 
 A breakdown of the Serbian seats in the new joint legislature shows that the Democratic Opposition of Serbia Reform caucus is taking 37 seats. 
 The Serbian Democratic Party will have 17, the Socialist Party of Serbia 12 and the Serbian Radical Party eight, while the Social Democratic Party and the Serbian Unity Party are taking five seats each. 
 The Christian Democratic Party and the Democratic Alternative will have two seats each, and the People's Socialist Party and the Serbia caucus will each take one. In Montenegro, 67 of the 68 lawmakers attending the republican parliament's session on Tuesday voted in the collective electoral list, including 19 deputies representing the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists and the Social Democratic Party coalition, nine members of the Socialist People's Party, three from the Serbian People's Party, and two each from the People's Party and the Liberal Alliance. 
 He stressed, however, that accession prospects hinged on their capacity to meet strict criteria for EU membership, including implementation of key reforms. 
 The OHR is expected to present similar audit reports next week on the Elektroprivreda companies in Sarajevo and Mostar, in the Federation of BiH (FBiH)."Mismanagement, conflicts of interest, theft and neglect are costing Elektroprivreda RS at least 166 million convertible marks [$91 million] annually," Ashdown's deputy, Donald Hays, said. Ashdown cited particular violations which Acimovic and Lemez committed, including willful or negligent failure to ensure effective and proper management, failure to introduce minimum financial controls and record keeping, and the awarding of contracts significantly below market value or contrary to the rules and procedures regarding award of tenders. In one case of tender manipulation, the company signed a contract with a London-based firm, the Energy Financing Team (EFT), for the sale of surplus electricity at below-market prices. 
 EFT bought the electricity from Elektroprivreda and then resold it to Montenegro at a profit of 40 per cent; a more typical profit margin is said to be in the range of 1 to 5 per cent. 
 Elektroprivreda also hired EFT to build new capacity in the entity and to export surpluses in the next 30 to 50 years. Ashdown said the two officials personally made financial gains from the misuse of their office. 
 The communists had honoured Princip for firing heroic shots that liberated his people from tyranny. Project head Bajro Gec said the new plaque is a sign that the city is taking a just-the-facts approach to marking the site."The public needs to have it pointed out loud and clear," he said. 
 In a city that suffered a three-and-a-half year siege in the 1990s because of Greater Serbia politics, commemorating the assassination is a sensitive issue. So this time around there will be no interpretation of the facts. 
 For now, however, they'll have to make due with a 60,000 KM donation from the city to both renovate the old museum and reinstate the footprints monument. 
  Back to History, Nature and Rusticity: a New Brand of Tourism Spreads Through Southeast Europe  17/03/2003 The Southeast European countries may be lagging behind their Western partners, but their rich historical heritage, beautiful landscapes and pastoral culture of hospitality represent a largely undiscovered tourist treasure. 
 Local tour operators attract foreign visitors with the prospect of safaris, fire-dancing in remote villages, or exploring semi-deserted religious sanctuaries. 
  Greek Terror Trial Opens Amid Unprecedented Security  03/03/2003 Suspected members of the 17 November terrorist group went on trial Monday (3 March) at a prison near Athens. 
 Cameras are banned in the courtroom and the defendants are sitting behind bulletproof glass.  (BBC - 03/03/03; AP, Reuters - 02/03/03; BBC - 19/07/02)The trial of 19 alleged members of Greece's November 17 terrorist group opened in Athens on Monday (3 March), amid unprecedented security. 
 The far-left guerrilla group, named for a student uprising against Greece's former military dictatorship, emerged with the murder of CIA Athens station chief Richard Welch in 1975. 
 But Kourtovik also said the suspect is denying guilt for actions attributed to him "according to the way they are explained in the case file".The defendants insist that the outcome of the trial, which is being conducted by a specially established panel of three judges, has been decided in advance. Sparking protests from journalists, authorities have barred cameras and tape recorders from the courtroom, saying they want to prevent the trial from turning into a public spectacle."The authorities want to guarantee a trial beyond reproach... to throw light on an affair that caused pain and damaged the country for 30 years," Justice Minister Philippos Petsalnikos said. Among the spectators Monday in the packed courtroom was Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyanni, whose husband was one of the victims. 
 During Annan's talks in Ankara, Athens and Cyprus, he repeatedly said that this is the last chance for a solution. 
 Milorad Drljevic of Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists was elected deputy speaker. Lawmakers also adopted temporary rules on the constitution and on the organisation and operation of parliament, pending the approval of permanent regulations, due to be drafted within two months at most. Proceedings had to be adjourned for more than an hour as Serbian opposition parties protested the verification of seats, insisting that the composition of the legislature did not accurately reflect the real will of the Serbian people. 
 Three of the ministerial seats will likely go Serbs and two to Montenegrins. 
 Washington has emphasised the importance of establishing modern military forces; despite this challenge, there is a conviction in Tirana that the United States will be a determining factor. 
 There are even plans for the Charter to be signed in Washington. The governments in Tirana, Zagreb and Skopje seem convinced that through their combined efforts, they will increase their chances to board the NATO train. 
  Electricity Audits Prove Politicians Abusing Public Companies  24/03/2003 The international community's audits of BiH's electricity utilities suggest the extent to which politicians may be using public companies for their own benefit.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 24/03/03 The open secret that some politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) use public companies as their playground is finally being documented by a series of audits into the country's electricity utilities, said an analyst in Sarajevo."I think it's a wonderful way of putting the cat amongst the pigeons. 
 "But many, like me, are surprised by the scale of this."The audit uncovered the fact that HDZ offices never paid electricity bills, and that the company awarded contracts to companies connected with the party. 
 AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan is running for a seat in parliament that would open his path to the prime minister's post. 
 He said the Council should seek a broad consensus on the Iraqi issue; failure to do so would be a "trauma" for the international community. Italy is not among the 15 current members of the Security Council, where Bulgaria holds a non-permanent seat. 
 While both countries have repeatedly stated their preference for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, they have also said they would back military action if no other option remains. As part of the build-up for a potential war on Iraq, Bulgaria has already offered the United States use of its Sarafovo air base in the town of Bourgas on the Black Sea and a 150-strong unit to handle non-conventional warfare threats. Upon his return from Washington last week, Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov said Bulgaria could possibly provide four or five bases to the United States, stressing this would be beneficial to both the national economy and security. Frattini expressed support for Bulgaria's efforts to maintain close contacts with NATO and provide military bases to members of the bloc before the country's actual admission to the alliance. 
  Erdogan Wins Parliamentary Seat, Will Likely Become Turkish Prime Minister  10/03/2003 Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party won Sunday's by-elections in the province of Siirt, allowing party leader Recip Tayyip Erdogan to replace Abdullah Gul as prime minister.  (Reuters, CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Independent - 10/03/03; AP, BBC, Reuters, VOA - 09/03/03)Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), won a seat in parliament during by-elections held Sunday (9 March) in the southeastern province of Siirt. 
 The victory makes it possible for Erdogan to replace his close associate Abdullah Gul as prime minister. Finals results show the AKP won some 84.7 per cent of the vote on Sunday. Erdogan, 49, a former Istanbul mayor, led his party to a landslide victory in parliamentary elections last November. 
 "For the first time there are no foreign troops on Croatian soil, for the first time we don't have a foreign boss, not even a 'father'," he said. Croatia submitted its formal application for EU membership last month, hoping to join the Union in early 2007, with Bulgaria and Romania. Racan told SDP members that what Europe wants to see in Croatia is respect for human rights, more refugee returns, as well as co-operation with neighbours and international institutions, including the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
 "There is still not enough agreement in Croatia about these issues," he warned. His remarks came two days after Croatian President Stipe Mesic told Goran Svilanovic, the foreign minister of Serbia-Montenegro, that their two countries and Bosnia and Herzegovina should make joint efforts to tackle the issue of refugee returns. Focusing on the other priority -- economic development -- Racan acknowledged that the government has been slow in implementing needed reforms, but said it had moved the country "away from the brink of an economic, even political abyss, while simultaneously maintaining stability".Discussing infrastructure projects, he cited 1.8 billion euros of investments in the country's railway sector, a gas supply system and a highway linking Zagreb with the port city of Split."The Zagreb-Split highway is the test of our abilities, it will be an opportunity to gauge the development capabilities of our municipalities, cities and counties," Racan said, also announcing a highway project to link Split with Dubrovnik further to the south. 
 Calling on national governments to take similar actions against suspected agents of the Baghdad regime, Washington said it had identified 300 such agents in 60 countries, including some serving as diplomats. Romanian officials denied that the expulsions had been carried out under US pressure, describing them instead as a "purely Romanian operation"."The decision was taken after concluding the incompatibility of the activity of these people regarding the provisions of the Vienna Convention for diplomats," the foreign ministry said in a statement. 
 Following the overthrow of the communist regime in late 1989, however, relations between Bucharest and Baghdad soured, especially as Romania chose the path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. Romania is now among the countries supporting Washington's stand on Iraq and recently offered its air and military facilities, as well as several hundred non-combat troops, for a possible war. Last week, Bucharest said it had closed its embassy in Iraq. SRI Director Radu Timofte told lawmakers several days ago that over a third of the approximately 3,000 Iraqis residing in Romania had left the country in February; he said his service was keeping an eye on "just a few" of those that stayed behind. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Ioan Rus suggested Monday that more expulsions of Iraqi citizens would follow shortly "for security reasons". 
 Lack of mobility affects access to health care and education, narrows employment opportunities and ultimately does not allow individuals to lead a normal life. 
 Prior to that, he was mayor of Nis and a staunch opponent of Slobodan Milosevic. 
 He is considered a pro-Western reformist with a commitment to democratisation. Meanwhile, authorities continue the search for those behind the assassination. 
 But key suspects Milorad Lukovic, Dejan Milenkovic and more than a dozen other leading members of the gang remain at large. On Friday, police began demolishing a fortified complex owned by Dusan Spasojevic, suspected of plotting Djindjic's murder. Reuters reports that four of the detainees have been granted protected witness status and are said to have confirmed alleged connections between the Zemun gang and a Colombian drug cartel. 
 The accord, signed by NATO Secretary General George Robertson and Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou during a two-day meeting of EU defence ministers in Athens, permits the exchange of confidential information between the two organisations, as well as the Union's access to NATO planning and logistical facilities. On Monday, Robertson announced that the alliance had agreed to allow the EU rapid reaction force to take over from Allied Harmony. 
 Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski handed an official invitation for the deployment of Union troops to EU security chief Javier Solana in Brussels. Robertson said the agreement was "one of the most important foundation stones" of the EU project for building a common security and defence policy. Papandreou, whose country holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, described the accord as a symbol of the confidence between the alliance and the Union, saying that it comes "at a particularly crucial time for the Balkans and for Europe in general."The EU-led operation in Macedonia is seen as a key test of the Union's determination and preparedness for such missions, particularly in light of its plans to take over the 13,000-strong NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina next year and its ambition to have a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force in place by the middle of this year. Saturday, at a joint press conference with Solana following the Athens meeting, Papandreou said there were many obstacles and delays the EU had to overcome to meet its goal. 
  BiH Directors Building on Tanovic's Success  18/03/2003 Some of Bosnia and Herzegovina's film directors are noticing that both foreign producers and domestic audiences are paying closer attention to their work after their countryman won last year's Oscar for Best Foreign Film.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 18/03/03 Ever since Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)-born director Danis Tanovic waved his Best Foreign Film statue at last year's Oscars and announced, "This is for my country; this is for Bosnia and Herzegovina," other directors in BiH have noticed that what they do is gaining more attention, both domestically and internationally."Now our movies are coming from a country that also has an Oscar," said director Dino Mustafic, who recently released his first feature film,  Remake . 
 "The worldwide success of  No Man's Land  is drawing the attention of the world film industry towards film authors from Bosnia and Herzegovina."Filmmakers here are building on that buzz.  Remake , the violent story of how war affects the friendship of Tarik and his Serb best friend, interwoven with Tarik's father's story from World War II, was chosen among the top five films, out of 450 screened at the recent Rotterdam festival. 
 You have to have a Bosnian base."Begic said that filmmakers are using the momentum from Tanovic's Oscar, pointing out that  Remake  is among three features to be released this year alone. 
 And one tangible result of Tanovic's success is that for the first time in history, BiH has a fund for cinema."The Oscar woke up these politicians here. 
 Among the recognisably funny characters in her first short film  Prvo smrtno iskustvo  (First Death Experience), is a greasy, gold-chain-wearing official who refuses to issue a young man an ID card because the man was reported killed during the war. 
 Begic said she'd also include comic relief in her first feature about a village of women trying to survive five years after the war. Remake  went the other way, according to Mustafic. 
  Macedonian Children Exchange Guns for Books  31/03/2003 Illegal possession of weapons continues to be an issue in Macedonia, but the government and NGOs are tackling the problem, starting with the children.  By Slobodanka Jovanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 31/03/03 The children from Skopje and Resen turned in their pistols and received books. 
 The idea is to continue with this awareness campaign until disarmament is complete, and for no less than six months. The first campaign action was called "Books for Guns". 
 Schoolchildren were encouraged to give up toy weapons, receiving books as a reward. 
 He went on to add that Washington should consider Macedonia an ally. Under the constitution, the decision must be approved by the national legislature, which is dominated by members of Crvenkovski's For Macedonia coalition. Earlier, President Boris Trajkovski said it was crucial for Macedonia to "stand behind the United States and do this clearly and unambiguously in appropriate form and procedure in compliance with the constitutional order". 
 He praised Trajkovski and Crvenkovski for their "vision and principled leadership", their commitment to the implementation of the Ohrid peace agreement, and for joining the international anti-terror coalition."Together, we will confront and defeat the threat to global security posed by the combination of weapons of mass destruction, the scourge of terrorism, and those states that sponsor or abet terrorism", Bush wrote, assuring Crvenkovski also that the United States "will not forget those who have stood with us".Although Macedonia is not going to be involved in any direct combat action, it hopes to be part of the post-war reconstruction of Iraq. Defence Minister Vlado Buckosvki is expected to discuss his country's role, as well as its preparations for NATO accession, when he meets in Washington this week with US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and others. In other news, NATO Secretary General George Robertson announced that the Alliance has agreed to let the new EU rapid reaction force take over its mission in Macedonia. 
 The trial against suspected November 17 terrorists opened in Athens two weeks ago and is expected to take months. The defendants, accused of murders, bombings and robberies committed since 1975, would likely face life sentences if convicted. 
 His statement came amid criticism from President Georgi Parvanov, who disagrees with the decision to enter the US-led coalition. But in Bucharest on Wednesday, Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase emphasised his country's support for it, adding that the Iraq crisis unveiled "tension in the world system" which he described as likely to become "a pretty extensive issue in the future".In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters that Bulgaria had changed its mind after initially preferring to remain among the 15 countries privately backing the United States. 
 Round-the-clock border surveillance is being introduced in the 12-mile zone of Black Sea territorial waters; ships caught smuggling people, drugs or arms within the past five years have been placed on a list of high-risk vessels. In addition, the country has adopted a plan to protect 25 to 30 strategic targets. 
 Rossin said the government's indecision would have an impact on ties between Washington and Zagreb. 
 A police statement issued 13 March said the Serbian public prosecution offices and Sarajlic's home were being searched. 
 The first of several scandals occurred following the October 1998 murder of four associates of then-opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, in a pre-arranged car accident. 
  More Than 1,000 Arrested in Crackdown on Organised Crime in Serbia  21/03/2003 As Serbian authorities continue to search for the killers of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, the country's deputy prosecutor has admitted to being on the payroll of the criminal gang presumed responsible for the murder.  (FT - 21/03/03; AP, BBC, Radio B92, RFE/RL - 20/03/03)More than 1,000 people have been arrested in connection with the slaying of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, Serbian officials said Thursday (20 March). 
 They say he also admitted taking orders from one of the cartel's leaders, Dusan Spasojevic, whom police believe is among those who plotted Djindjic's murder. The fired prosecutor said he had recently received 150,000 euros, out of a promised 1m euros, for information concerning the whereabouts of a protected witness. 
 The clarification followed reports suggesting Bucharest had already made the decision. After consultations with officials at the US Embassy in Bucharest on Friday, foreign ministry spokesman Cosman Dobran told reporters that Bucharest was analysing Washington's request for the expulsion of Iraqi diplomats. 
 Earlier, Deputy Foreign Minister Lyubomir Ivanov said a decision would be made after authorities have reviewed the options offered by international law, above all the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and after they have received some additional information from Washington. The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) says authorities should have expelled the head of the Iraqi diplomatic mission in Sofia earlier for some threatening remarks he made about Bulgaria. 
  Former General, Aides Convicted in Croatian War Crimes Trial  25/03/2003 A trial widely seen as a test of the Croatian judiciary's ability to handle war crimes cases ended Monday with the sentencing of a former army general and two others.  (AP, Reuters, BBC, VOA, RFE/RL, HINA - 24/03/03)Croatia's highest profile war crimes trial to date ended Monday (24 March) with prison sentences for former army Gen Mirko Norac and two others, convicted of organising and carrying out the execution of 50 Serb civilians in the town of Gospic during Croatia's war for independence in October 1991.Norac, 35, the most senior Croatian officer convicted of war crimes in a domestic trial so far, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. 
 Zivkovic said the suspect was linked to the criminal gang known as the Zemun Clan, believed to have planned and carried out Djindjic's assassination. 
 The investigation has also unveiled close connections between Serbian organised crime groups, the judiciary and the entertainment business. Along with Jovanovic, police arrested another JSO, Sasa Pejakovic, suspected to have aided the sniper in carrying out the assassination. 
 Following an extraordinary session on Tuesday, the government said it had decided to disband the unit."The government has ordered unit members to hand in their weapons, equipment, uniforms and official identity cards," it said in a press release, adding that it has assigned the Gendarmerie the task of securing the JSO premises in the northern town of Kula. During the Balkan conflicts in the 1990's, the Milosevic regime sent crime figures to fight with its infamous paramilitary forces, commanded by Zeljko Raznatovic. 
 Milorad Lukovic is a former JSO commander and is reportedly one of the bosses of a powerful drug cartel. By declaring war on organised crime in Serbia and promising to arrest UN war crimes indictees, Djindjic infuriated many. In November 2001, JSO officers staged protests against the government, saying they would no longer participate in the arrests of those wanted by The Hague tribunal. 
 Since then, the countries have held two rounds of accession talks with NATO experts, covering both the formal obligations of membership, as well as specific issues and reforms they would be expected to carry out to enhance their contribution to the alliance. 
 Following the discussions, each of the invited countries has submitted a letter of intent confirming its interest, willingness and ability to join NATO, accompanied by a timetable for the completion of the agreed reforms, which might continue after the country's entry into the alliance. The accession protocols are amendments to NATO's founding document, the North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington on 4 April 1949. 
 Following their ratification by all NATO member states, the invited countries will also have to ratify the protocols before sending all relevant accession documents to the US State Department. At the ceremony, NATO Secretary General George Robertson called it "a vindication of the vision of all those who have, for many years, sought to anchor their countries firmly to a Europe with which they share democratic values" and "a testament to the hard work of all those who have been involved in turning that vision into a reality".Confident about the successful completion of the ratification process by the next NATO summit in May 2004, Robertson urged the invitees to remain focused on the implementation of their reform programmes, "to ensure that they can make a meaningful contribution to this alliance".Robertson also praised the alliance for opening its doors to the seven former communist countries and voiced confidence that this decision would go down in history as a "turning point in the building of a Europe reunited and free: a Europe united in peace, democracy and common values, from the Baltics to the Balkans, from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. 
 Jovica Stanisic and Franco Simatovic were among the first to be detained in the sweep on organised crime initiated hours after Djindjic's murder. About 15 former members of the JSO have been arrested on suspicion of complicity in the assassination. 
 They said one of the killers, a member of the recently disbanded Special Police Unit (JSO), had led them to the site. Following the discovery, police reportedly launched a search for Mirjana Markovic at the couple's Belgrade residence and at their house in hometown of Pozarevac. 
 But Markovic's daughter, Marija Milosevic, told the Montenegrin daily  Publika  that her mother was in Moscow visiting her son, Marko, who fled the country soon after his father's overthrow in October 2000. 
 "Let them [the police] issue a warrant," Marija quoted her mother as telling her in a telephone conversation. 
  Suicide Rate Up in Kosovo Since War  02/04/2003 A recent survey shows a 300 per cent increase in the suicide rate in one district in Kosovo.  By Natan Dotan for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 02/04/03 According to a recent survey by American psychologist Majd Kamalmaz, there has been a 300 per cent increase in the suicide rate in Kosovo's Drenica district over the past three years. Kamalmaz's research revealed that, in the 40 years before the war, there had been only one case of suicide in the Drenica district. 
  Political Compromise in Tirana is Functioning  04/04/2003 Albania's two main political parties have put aside their differences and approved the establishment of a commission to examine the use of public funds by the city of Tirana.  By Orest Erzeni for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 03/04/03 Last month, the Albanian Parliament approved the establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate the use of public funds, since 1992, by the municipality of Tirana. 
 To arrive at this vote, the two main parties, the ruling Socialist Party (SP) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) had to overcome a political conflict that dogged parliament for one month. DP had requested establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate the activities of Mayor Edi Rama, who was elected in 2000 with SP support. 
 The toughest race is the mayoral one in Tirana, the post Rama currently holds. 
 He has created the image of a charismatic and energetic mayor, receiving a prize from the UN last year for his work on behalf of the city. 
 He feels it is critical therefore that the EU show greater commitment in providing the needed support. The president of the European Stability Initiative (ESI), Gerald Knaus, told the members of the European Parliament that the Western Balkans region faces two major threats today: organised crime and social and economic decline. By introducing more cohesion in its strategy for the region, the EU could help solve the social together with the economic problems, Knaus said, adding that in return, the Western Balkan countries should commit themselves to carry on the reform process and the fight against organised crime. 
  First 600 Srebrenica Victims Buried at Potocari Memorial Site  01/04/2003 After eight years, the survivors of the Srebrenica massacre have a memorial site to mourn their loved ones.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 01/04/03 It was the same place where they'd last seen their men alive -- a looted factory just outside the small Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) town of Srebrenica. 
 The cobbled walkway arcing around the site was crowded with women in scarves, crouching and weeping by the lines of green-covered coffins."What's there to say?" said one as she surveyed the gravesite. 
 Three opposition parties holding about 40 per cent of the seats in the 482-member legislature -- the Democratic Party, the National Liberal Party and the nationalist Greater Romania Party (PRM) -- then submitted a motion for a vote of no confidence. 
 If extradited to The Hague, he will be the last of 18 Bosnian Croat indictees to appear before the court. Rajic, 45, is being held responsible for the killing of at least 16 Muslim civilians during an attack on the village of Stupni Dol in central BiH on 23 October 1993. 
 During it, the more than 200 survivors were forced to flee the village; their property was virtually destroyed. The Croatian Interior Ministry announced the arrest in a statement on Sunday, saying it was carried out "on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague". 
 Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has been claiming for months that Mladic is hiding in Serbia under army protection, an allegation Belgrade has been denying. 
 Former army officers Veselin Sljivancanin and Miroslav Radic are also wanted by prosecutors in The Hague for their alleged involvement in the 1991 murders of hundreds of civilians near the Croatian city of Vukovar. On Monday, Zivkovic admitted that Mladic might have been under the protection of "certain individuals within the army". 
 Implementation of the project is expected to boost Maritsa East 3's output capacity to 900 MgW and reduce the current levels of harmful sulphur dioxide emissions by over 90 per cent, bringing them in line with international standards. 
 After it is completed, coal supplies will be secured under long-term agreements with the Maritsa East Mines and the entire output of the power plant will be sold to Bulgaria's National Electricity Company (NEK).Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, who attended the official opening of the project the southern town of Stara Zagora, stressed its strategic national and regional importance. 
 International Olympic Committee (IOC) inspectors say it is feasible, but have cautioned organisers to stay on track.  (ATHENS 2004 Organising Committee, BBC - 10/04/03; AP, Reuters, CNN - 09/04/03)Greek officials have assured International Olympic Committee (IOC) inspectors that, despite some delays, all projects for the Summer Olympics in Athens will be completed in time for the games, which open 13 August 2004. 
 We would never put their quality at risk," the head of the Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC), Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, was quoted as saying. In a press release, Daskalaki assured that all involved were "working hard throughout Greece". 
 Athens will be ready to host seven test events -- archery, canoe-kayak, cycling, equestrian, rowing, sailing and beach volleyball -- at their respective Olympic venues 12 months before the opening ceremony, ATHOC said. According to Daskalaki, many of the problems that occurred earlier were resolved through improved co-ordination among agencies. The ATHOC chief said that over 70,000 people have already signed up to serve as volunteers during the Games, only 14 months after the official launch of the programme. 
 But given recent military-associated scandals, it's essential.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 18/04/03 Placing Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) two entity militaries under a common command, as the BiH presidency recently promised NATO that it will work to do, will be a very difficult job, but one analyst said it has to be done."The old Yugoslav Army did that by having mixed units where they could, but trying to reintegrate these units is going to create huge problems," said Richard Bennett, a senior analyst at Armed Forces Intelligence Research. Bennett added, however, that such reintegration is necessary not only to avoid scandals like the recent arms-for-Iraq affair, in which a company from the Republika Srpska (RS) violated the UN embargo by selling weapons to Iraq, but also to remove the influence of foreign fundamentalists who served in the Bosnian Army during the 1992-1995 war."Merging the armed forces into a national armed force is probably one of the ways that [the international community] can see as achieving that as quickly as possible," he said. The idea of restructuring the two entity militaries has been more prominent than ever lately, given the fallout from the arms-for-Iraq scandal and the recent discovery that the RS military had been spying on politicians and international organisations. 
 The students were returning home Sunday from a school trip to Athens.  (Reuters, The Independent, Times Online, ANA, MPA, News.bg - 14/04/03; AP, AFP - 13/04/03)Twenty-four teenagers were killed and another 31 people were injured late Sunday (13 April) in Greece when a truck loaded with plywood hit a school bus. 
 The crash occurred at a narrow winding road section in the Tembi Valley, some 350 km north of Athens. 
 It then hit the left side of the bus, slamming it onto the rocks bordering the road. The bus was taking 48 students, aged 14 to 16, back to their village of Makrohori -- 70 km north of the site of the accident -- following a three-day trip to Athens. 
 Hitting the plywood strewn over the road, three cars driving behind the bus burst into flames, but none of the occupants was injured, according to reports."I was dragged out by a friend but there were dead bodies everywhere," one of the teenagers told Greek television. 
 Television reports showed rescue workers pulling mangled bodies from what remained of the bus, with its seats strewn on the road. 
 Shocked survivors, their faces bloodied, were shown weeping by the side of the road. A dozen ambulances carried the victims to hospitals in Larissa and Katerini. 
  Macedonian Government Signals Readiness to Legalise Tetovo University  17/04/2003 Tetovo University in Macedonia is on the path to becoming recognised as part of the country's education system. 
 That could help smooth ethnic tensions.  (Institute for War and Peace Reporting - 11/04/03; various background sources)Established in 1994, the Albanian-language Tetovo University (TU) could officially become part of Macedonia's education system once the procedures for its legalisation are completed. 
 "There is political will to include institutions such as Tetovo University in the system."Four days later his deputy, Tale Geramitcioski, said the legalisation process had been launched, but warned "it would only be applied to those TU faculties which meet the standards required by law."TU's acting rector, Naxhmedin Beadini, pledged the university would work in close co-operation with the education ministry to meet the government criteria. Since its inception, TU has been partly funded by student tuition fees, but largely by contributions from ethnic Albanians living abroad. 
 The 126-seat legislature passed the amendments to the law on co-operation by a vote of 77 to 16. 
 Is a new approach needed to speed up the region's European integration?  Analysis by Liz Barrett for Southeast European Times in Budapest - 17/04/03 On Wednesday (16 April), history was made in Athens. 
 And it has also proved a useful stimulus to reforms, offering the "carrot" of European integration to governments willing to fulfil EU conditions, rather than just the "stick" which hung over talks with Brussels in the past. 
 But the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) has weaknesses, and these could become increasingly apparent after the first wave of EU enlargement. First of all, it is not clear that the SAP carrot is attractive enough to hold the attention of the countries that are lagging behind. 
 A recent paper from Oxford University's Southeast European Studies Programme has called for the EU to make conditionality more of a two-way process, listening to the needs of the region as well as stipulating the conditions necessary to comply with EU standards. 
 The witness said the Yugoslav Army provided the Tigers with weapons and gasoline, acting on the orders of Milosevic's army general, Dusan Loncar. The UN war crimes tribunal indicted Arkan in 1997 for involvement in the killings of hundreds of civilians. 
 A mission of the Turkish business association is due to visit Washington next month to "warm up" bilateral relations. A former US ambassador to Ankara and current chair of Friends of Turkey, Mark Parris, said there was "no predisposition" in Washington against the participation of Turkish companies in the reconstruction process. US Secretary of State Colin Powell called Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to thank Turkey for allowing humanitarian aid to pass through its territory and for its own contributions to the relief supplies."The world will be Turkey's oyster as far as reconstruction contracts in Iraq are concerned," the  Financial Times  quoted Parris as saying. 
 According to O'Sullivan, the loan is part of the Bank's assistance programme, totalling $200m, for Serbia-Montenegro in 2003.Lukovac said talks in Washington earlier this week between a Serbia-Montenegro delegation and Bank officials confirmed that even stronger support is forthcoming. 
 Serbian Finance and Economy Minister Bozidar Djelic said Tuesday that the Bank plans to release two $40m tranches as part of a social sector reform loan, as well as a second financial and private sector reform credit. Djelic also announced that the IMF would back the holding of a donor's conference for Serbia-Montenegro in September. Commending Serbia-Montenegro authorities "for the impressive further progress in stabilisation and reform achieved in 2002" and welcoming the "renewed commitment to reform of the new government following Prime Minister Djindjic's tragic assassination", IMF First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair Anne Krueger called for "continued prudence and vigilance in policy implementation".She also stressed the need for a tightening of monetary policy and further fiscal consolidation and for even greater decisiveness in the next and more difficult stages of implementing reforms."The formation of the state union of Serbia-Montenegro in early 2003 will enhance political stability and provide a unique window of opportunity for carrying forward the reform process," Krueger said, adding that the harmonisation of economic systems in the member states should help improve overall economic efficiency. In other news, the OSCE expressed satisfaction with the Serbian government's efforts to fight organised crime, and commended the government for announcing it will likely lift the state of emergency next week. 
 Officials say regional groups have revived the traffic in illegal refugees.  By Alban Bala for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 21/04/03 Albanian police have announced the arrest of those allegedly involved in a new human trafficking ring operating between Tirana, Belgrade and New York, and top police officials recently confirmed there is evidence that regional rings have revived trafficking through Albania. Speaking on 16 April, Tirana Police Director Ilirian Zylyftari said a police crackdown on speedboat traffic had prompted smugglers to involve Tirana's newly-opened JAT office in their schemes. 
 "The trafficking of illegal refugees was accomplished through the use of JAT Airlines," Zylyftari said. On 14 April, Serbian border police repatriated six Albanians who were carrying false travel documents. 
 To stop them, Albanian police have organised a double-check system, where ad hoc structures control travel agencies and the border police. Last week, police arrested the directors of the Besa football team, who were smuggling 30 young boys -- recruited as "under 21 players" -- to Italy. 
 On Saturday, Albanian Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports Arta Dade rejected allegations by Democratic Party spokesman Edi Paloka that officials of the ministry had issued fake visas to young people from Kavaje, allowing them entry to the Netherlands under the guise of a football team. 
 Rather, the government and the business community are hoping to portray Hungary as the gateway to a region with vast untapped potential. At the end of March, the Hungarian government hosted Stability Pact member states at a conference in Szeged, a city close to the Serbian border. 
 Radic, in his mid-thirties at the time, commanded a special infantry unit. In the last days of the siege, several hundred Croats and other non-Serbs sought refuge at a Vukovar hospital, believing that it would be evacuated in the presence of neutral international observers, as agreed by the Yugoslav Army and the Croatian government on 18 November 1991.But after Yugoslav Army units took control of the hospital, investigators say at least 200 people were loaded on buses and driven first to the army's barracks and then to a pig farm at Ovcara, about 4 km southeast of Vukovar. 
 Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul indicated Monday (21 April) that the government had agreed in principle, but was awaiting concrete terms and details before final approval. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Gul said that in addition to troops, Washington had requested doctors and other experts to help in humanitarian work and the rebuilding of Iraq."We are saying yes to all of these but it will become clear in the coming days how things will proceed and under what conditions," Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Gul as saying. He suggests Ankara is awaiting specifics from the US administration concerning the number of requested troops and the status of the proposed peacekeeping force -- that is, whether Turkish soldiers will be part of a mission led by the United States or NATO, or will operate under a UN mandate. 
 According to political analysts, these clashes could herald the reshuffling of political parties in Serbia. According to a research poll conducted by Medium Index -- a Gallup International public opinion agency -- the approval ratings of former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia and the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) have dropped since the assassination. 
 The list of sectors and companies that the government has put in its privatisation programme includes the energy corporation KESH, the General Directory of Railways, the Sea Port of Durres, the oil and gas sector, the coal mining and water supply sectors, and Albtransport. International financial institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF have continually encouraged privatisation of the strategic sectors. 
 According to government experts, the strategic economic objectives are undergoing careful international monitoring. 
 The charges have been filed with the Belgrade district prosecutor's office, which will carry out an investigation into the case before deciding whether to indict the suspects."We have evidence that Milosevic suggested Stambolic's permanent removal," the unnamed police official said. Stambolic disappeared while taking his morning jog in a Belgrade park on 25 August 2000, only weeks before presidential elections in which he was expected to run against Milosevic, a former ally turned foe. 
 Results are expected within the next few days. The patient, a 33-year-old man, returned to Bulgaria on 16 April after a long stay in Toronto, the city with the highest incidence of SARS cases in Canada. 
 Three days later, he was taken to Sofia's Infectious Diseases Hospital after developing SARS symptoms -- high fever, coughing and general weakness. 
 His symptoms were comparatively mild, doctors said. Tests have confirmed that the man has had a flu, but doctors said it was not the cause of the pneumonia he developed subsequently. On Sunday, Dr Katya Ivancheva of the Infectious Diseases Hospital was quoted as saying the patient's temperature was within normal limits, coughing had subsided and his appetite was back. 
 None of the 100 Bulgarians in China, including about 30 students attending universities in Beijing, Shanghai and Nanking, is said to have contracted SARS.As a result of the outbreak, Bulgaria tightened border medical control at Sofia Airport and the Black Sea ports of Varna and Bourgas two weeks ago. 
 In addition, Bulgarian Energy Minister Milko Kovachev and Regional Development Minister Valentin Tserovski are expected to travel to Ankara in early May, hoping to break a deadlock surrounding the ten-year agreement, signed in 1998.On Monday (21 April), state-owned Turkish Electricity Trade and Contracting Inc (TETAS) decided to suspend all electricity imports from Bulgaria, citing Sofia's failure to move ahead on two infrastructure projects that are part of the deal. 
 Earlier, the company warned Bulgaria it would discontinue electricity imports, but reversed its position following diplomatic efforts. Under the agreement, Turkey was to import electricity from Bulgaria in return for Turkish companies' participation in a highway construction project and a $300m hydroelectric power plant project. Turkey has been purchasing between 3.5 billion and 4.0 billion kilowatts of electric power from Bulgaria annually, at a price of $0.0355/kilowatt. 
 This amount accounts for about 55 per cent of Bulgaria's annual electricity exports and between 7 per cent and 8 per cent of the national electricity output. 
 Expressing the ministry's surprise and disappointment at TETAS' decision to halt the power purchases, the official described it as "hasty".Earlier this month, Gul denied media reports about possible cuts in his country's electricity imports from Bulgaria, and even suggested the imports could increase. 
  Official Tells Security Council UNMIK Must Stay  29/04/2003 Kosovo is not ready for the UN to pull out, a senior official tells the Security Council.  (UN - 23/04/03 - 25/04/03; Radio B92 - 24/04/03)A senior UN official has urged the Security Council to reject calls to end UNMIK, saying it plays a critical role in promoting dialogue and multiethnicity in the province, and aids the long process of establishing independent and functional governing institutions."The Mission has balanced the competing, and often conflicting, desires of the leaders and people in Kosovo without giving fodder to extremism," Assistant Secretary General Hedi Annabi said on 23 April, during the Security Council's open session on Kosovo. 
 The council will continue to pass on power to the provincial government in a phased manner, considering the target institutions' capacity, Annabi said. 
 Hotel bookings are beginning to rise, implying a profitable season for Turkish tourism. Surveys conducted during the war showed that safety concerns were the main factor deterring tourists from visiting Turkey. 
 "Many people in Europe unfortunately had thought that there were military operations that were also taking place on Turkish territory, but it is totally wrong," she said at a press conference last month. Tourism companies and hotel owners say they had cancellations in April and May, but the increasing number of new reservations signal that the summer season may be better. 
 Representatives of the tourism associations say that the majority of Europeans preferred to postpone their holidays instead of canceling. Meanwhile, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has affected tourism in the countries of East Asia. 
 Some Turkish companies regard the situation as an opportunity, and are designing public relations activities to attract tourists searching for a SARS-free destination. 
 Separately, authorities have charged former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and six others with the attempted murder of opposition political leader Vuk Draskovic in 2000.Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday (29 April), Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said Djindjic's murder was part of a conspiracy dubbed "Stop The Hague", which aimed to overthrow Serbia's reformist government and return nationalist forces to power."This was a terrorist-political assassination," Mihajlovic said. He added that two bosses of the Zemun Clan criminal organisation planned and carried out the murder plot. 
 He allegedly encouraged the two gang leaders to carry out the assassination. The ultranationalist politician is among five -- including former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica's security adviser, Rade Bulatovic, and former military intelligence chief Aco Tomic -- who have been charged with "associating to commit hostile activities". 
 Its epicentre, according to the Istanbul-based Kandilli seismology centre, was about 15 km northeast of the city of Bingol. 
 At least 25 buildings and a bridge in the city's centre have reportedly collapsed. 
 Five students were found dead, according to the city's mayor, Feyzullah Karaalsan. News reports from the site said children could be heard crying for help from under the debris of the panicked concrete building, while tearful parents and onlookers watched rescuers dig through the rubble. 
 Electricity and telephone service were cut off by the quake. Turkey lies on the active North Anatolian fault and has suffered a number of devastating earthquakes in the past. 
 The report allegedly linked local officials, magistrates and politicians to the underworld. In a letter to Borissov, Saxe-Coburg said he had studied the situation carefully, and did not see any reason to accept the resignation. 
 He expressed that view to Arben Xhaferri during a telephone conversation on 22 April. 
 A statement issued by the defence ministry stressed the order applies to all professional military personnel as well as to civilian army staff."When the accused are found at a military facility, military vehicle, military airplane or ship, professional members of the army of Serbia-Montenegro are obliged to act according to their service rules and detain them," the order said, specifying that it covers all suspects, regardless of their current rank or position. 
 Supervision of the municipalities would fall to the audit department, while the authority to dismiss mayors would be transferred to the judiciary from the interior ministry. The reform would also bring some changes to the structure of the central government, leading to the merger of state institutions tied to deputy prime ministers and certain ministries. 
 According to the unions, the closure of ministry offices would lead to unemployment and extra taxes. At the same time, the municipal mayors have objected to expanding the authority of government-appointed governors. 
 According to the mayors, these changes would block the authority they would acquire through the reforms. Intellectuals reject some aspects of reform, arguing that these will mean a greater burden placed on the shoulders of the long-suffering public. 
 He is the last of the so-called "Vukovar Three" -- the group of former officers indicted for this atrocity -- who remains at large. 
 Initially, all four indictees pleaded not guilty to the UN tribunal's charges against them, which include genocide or complicity to commit genocide, extermination, murder, and forcible transfer of Bosnian MuslimsIn early July 1995, when the Bosnian Serb Army staged its attack on Srebrenica, Nikolic was deputy commander for security and intelligence of the Bratunac Brigade, which was involved in the events. As part of the agreement with the UN prosecutors, Nikolic has admitted that more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men from the Srebrenica area, aged 16 to 60, were murdered between 12 July 1995 and 1 November 1995 and that he committed the atrocities "because the victims were Bosnian Muslims".In a signed personal declaration attached to the agreement, he also confessed to attending a meeting on 12 July 1995 to discuss "the operation to transport the women and children to Kladanj and separate, detain and kill the able-bodied Muslim men in Potocari". 
 The country lies on the active North Anatolian fault. Two major earthquakes near the city of Adapazari killed nearly 20,000 people in 1999. 
 Investigations found that contractors bought off politicians to win construction projects, which they then built using cheap, substandard materials rather than the high quality ones for which they billed. While Turkey has since imposed much stricter regulations, law enforcement and inspection are said to be inefficient, leaving the construction sector vulnerable to corruption. After a government meeting Monday, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said legislative changes would be made. Meanwhile, Tuncay Taymaz, head of the earthquake seismology department at Istanbul Technical University, urged authorities to consider a national "master plan" for the next major earthquake to hit the country. 
 EU government leaders have promised help with the balance of payments, by means of the CARDS programme and all other forms of support associated with the process of stabilisation. On Wednesday (7 May), the European Agency for Reconstruction announced it has approved an aid package, totalling 229m euros, for Serbia-Montenegro in 2003. 
 Tadic said he now expects his country will join the Partnership for Peace programme this year.  (AP, Reuters, RFE/RL, Radio B92, Tanjug, Washington File - 07/05/03)Serbia-Montenegro's hopes of joining NATO received a boost Wednesday (7 May) as ambassadors of the alliance hailed the country's military reform efforts and offered assistance in implementing further democratic changes. 
 We have been impressed by the progress made in Serbia-Montenegro since that tragic event," Clare Short, the chairwoman of the EBRD Board of Governors, said in her closing statement at the institution's 12th Annual Meeting in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent, on 4 May and 5 May. The EBRD was established in 1991, following the collapse of communism, with a mandate to "help build market economies and democracies" in 27 countries stretching from central Europe to central Asia. 
 Two others -- Bulgaria and Romania -- are expected to follow soon. The meeting in Tashkent was the first to take place in a Central Asian country. 
 The Bank, however, said its main goal this year was to place the focus on Central Asia. The forum brought together about 3,000 participants, including businessmen, NGOs, journalists and officials. 
 The detainee, Dragan Vasiljevic, was apprehended early Thursday (8 May), during a joint operation by SFOR and Bosnian Serb police."Vasiljevic is suspected of being part of the network supporting Borovcanin and is thought to have acted as his driver and bodyguard," SFOR spokesman Jeff Coverdale told reporters."This detention was carried out under SFOR's continuing mandate to maintain a safe and secure environment within Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)," SFOR said in a press release. 
 Vasiljevic's computer and mobile phones were reportedly confiscated. Coverdale said Vasiljevic was being questioned by SFOR personnel and would later be handed over to the RS authorities for further action. 
 SFOR's mandate allows peacekeepers to hold BiH citizens in detention for an unlimited period of time. A former senior Bosnian Serb police officer, Borovcanin was indicted in September 2002 on six counts of complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war. 
 He was allegedly involved in the extermination, murder, persecution, forcible transfer and torture of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica, Potcari, Zvornik and other areas in July 1995.In an unrelated development, the UN tribunal said Thursday the trial against one of the highest ranking Bosnian Serb indictees -- former speaker of the RS Parliament and one-time Karadzic ally Momcilo Krajisnik -- is being put off indefinitely. 
 We admit there are a large number of Albanian companies that are interested in participating in Iraq's reconstruction."The US State Department recently offered the position of governor of Basra to Albanian Deputy Foreign Minister Luan Hajdaraga for the next six months. Albania's ties with Washington entered a new era during the Iraq war. 
 Official results will be announced in several days. Vujanovic, 48, a lawyer and father of three, has also previously held the posts of justice minister and interior minister. 
 Six newspapers and journals were closed for 79 days; nine journalists were taken into custody; and seven books, 17 magazines, seven newspapers and three posters were confiscated and banned on charges such as offending Turkish morality, inciting people against different political factions, etc."Turkish law forbids torture, but there have been notable lapses in punishing those responsible, with the accused given minor sentences or released altogether. 
  US Calls for Increased Communication Between Belgrade and Pristina  13/05/2003 Stephan Minikes, the US Ambassador to OSCE, believes dialogue would help "ease tensions and reinforce ongoing efforts to promote meaningful Serb participation" in Kosovo institutions.  (Washington File - 12/05/03)Building a multiethnic, democratic society in Kosovo that respects the rule of law is essential both for the sake of its people and for the greater stability of the entire region, the US Ambassador to the OSCE told members of the 55-nation body. 
 Addressing the OSCE's Permanent Council, Stephan Minikes also called for increased dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina."The situation in Kosovo, and in the Balkans more generally, continues to be of great importance to the United States," Minikes said in Vienna on Thursday (8 May), noting the recent visits of Secretary of State Colin Powell to Belgrade and Tirana and his upcoming trip to Sofia. In a speech following a report by UNMIK chief Michael Steiner, the ambassador voiced Washington's support for efforts to "enhance and sustain" the dialogue on technical issues between Belgrade and Pristina. 
 Voicing support for ongoing efforts to transfer all non-reserved authorities to the provisional institutions of self-government by the end of 2003, Minikes said work in this area should be carried out in close co-operation with local leaders."The effective implementation of Security Council Resolution 1244 requires a healthy dialogue between UNMIK and the international community. 
 For this, he said, "respect for minority rights is absolutely required".Minikes noted Washington's commitment to provide more than $14m this year towards continuing the momentum for sustainable returns to Kosovo, and called on international donors "to follow-through as soon as possible to make 2003 truly a watershed year for minority returns".Other areas the ambassador cited as needing improvements were legislation and respect for the rule of law. 
  Canada Provides Health Care Reform, Refugee Assistance to BiH  14/05/2003 During a three-day visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Canadian Minister for International Co-operation Susan Whelan reaffirmed her country's support for peace and prosperity in BiH and the Balkans.  (CNEWS, CTV - 11/05/03; AFP, Canada News Wire, Canadian International Development Agency - 09/05/03)Canadian Minister for International Co-operation Susan Whelan arrived on a three-day visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Friday (9 May) to reiterate Ottawa's support for reform efforts and the refugee return process."Canada remains committed to peace and prosperity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Balkans region as a whole. 
 According to the minister, $2m of the new contributions will be donated to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to find long-term solutions for refugees and internally displaced persons in the Balkans. Of the remaining funding, $550,000 is to be used for strengthening Canada's participation in SFOR, NATO's mine detection activities, and infrastructure reconstruction projects for returning refugees and internally displaced persons. Finally, $150,000 has been earmarked to support the Canadian International Demining Corps' efforts to improve mine detection dog teams' capacity to clear land for returning refugees. During her visit, Whelan met High Representative Paddy Ashdown and other international officials. 
  2004 Olympics Organisers Launch Worldwide Ticket Sales Campaign  14/05/2003 The first day of ticket sales for the 2004 Summer Olympics surpassed the same day of sales for the Sydney Games in 2000.  (Reuters, AP, AFP - 13/05/03; Washington Post, VOA, AP, Reuters - 12/05/03)Tickets for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens went on sale Monday (12 May) and organisers said demand was high on the first day of the month-long campaign. 
 With about three million tickets set aside for the public, they advised people to make their bookings early, rather than wait until the closing date of 12 June."It's still too early to say, but you can be sure that there will be great demand for them so it is best to act now and book tickets early," Greek government spokesman Telemachos Hytiris said. Although concrete figures for Monday's sales were unavailable, ticketing manager Mary Manolopoulou said requests from national Olympic committees, which sell tickets to the public, exceeded the initial orders for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Residents of non-EU countries can buy tickets either through their national Olympic committees or an authorised dealer, while those living in any of the EU member states can do so through the 2004 Olympics Web site, by phone or at a branch of Greece-based Alpha Bank. 
 The three US licensed agents -- Cartan, Jet Set Sports and CoSport -- have already secured about 150,000 tickets, but expect demand to boost that number to more than 170,000.In addition to the three million tickets for the public, 2.3 million have been reserved for International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials, sponsors, TV rights holders and others associated with the games. 
 Organisers said all those tickets have been already purchased. To make the tickets affordable for Greeks, the Athens Olympic Committee (ATHOC) has decided to sell tickets at prices that are, on average, 34 per cent lower than those for the Sydney Olympics. 
 Those who want to watch the opening ceremony at the Olympic stadium will have to pay between $109 and $1,035 per seat. According to the  Washington Post , the major ticket agent in the United States will offer some extras, including cruise and vacation packages, terrorism insurance and high-security lodging. 
 Cartan, for example is said to be offering six-day cruise liner packages, pricedbetween $6,700 and $13,800.No special ticket quota has been reserved for Greeks. 
 Greece hopes to generate about $200m from ticket sales alone, amounting to 9 per cent of the estimated total revenue from the 17-day games, which open on 13 August 2004.Athens, however, is concerned about "the participation of representatives of Asian countries affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)", Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Monday, after a meeting of top Olympics organisers and government officials, chaired by Prime Minister Costas Simitis. Expressing hope that the SARS crisis will have been resolved by the time of the games, officials said they were awaiting an IOC decision on possible measures following its meeting Friday in Madrid. On Tuesday, the Greek Health Ministry reported on the first suspected SARS case in the country -- a foreign flight attendant who was recently in Hong Kong. 
 In this case, we will pay a total of $1.1 billion, and at least $700m of this $1.1 billion will return to the country's economy.""We are carrying through with this project on the basis of requests from the Turkish Armed Forces," he added. 
 They face an additional charge of complicity to commit genocide. All three have pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against them by UN prosecutors, blaming their superiors and subordinates for the atrocities. 
 If convicted, they could be sentenced to life imprisonment."These accused and their troops were absolutely critical to the success of the murder operation and none of them had the strength of character or courage necessary to say 'no' and to walk away," prosecutor Peter McCloskey said in his opening statement. The Srebrenica massacre has been described as the worst atrocity in European history since World War II. 
 "In fact, Bulgaria proved itself willing to send its sons and daughters to this effort, the most profound commitment that a country can make."Powell pledged Washington's support for Bulgaria's efforts in fighting corruption, carrying out judicial reforms and promoting economic growth -- steps which he described as key ones for future NATO members to take. 
 That is our commitment and our obligation," he said. Bulgaria and the United States established diplomatic relations on 19 September 1903, when Washington's first envoy, John Jackson, presented his diplomatic credentials to King Ferdinand, the grandfather of Bulgaria's current prime minister. 
  Turkey Ends 40-Year Travel Ban on Greek Cypriots  19/05/2003 Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the lifting of travel restrictions as a gesture of goodwill, and called on Greek authorities to take reciprocal steps.  (International herald Tribune - 19/05/03; Washington Times, AP, CNN, Anatolian Agency - 18/05/03; BBC, Anatolian Agency 17/05/03; AP, BBC, AFP, Reuters - 23/04/03)Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Saturday (17 May) that Turkey is lifting travel restrictions on Greek Cypriots, allowing citizens of the southern part of the divided island to visit Turkey for the first time in almost 40 years. 
 Describing the move as a gesture of goodwill towards the Greek Cypriot authorities, Erdogan has called on Greece to take reciprocal steps."Turkey is opening its gates to all Greek Cypriots," Erdogan said in the southern resort city of Antalya. 
 Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovenia also are expected to send delegations. According to  Dnevnik , the five Western Balkan countries are likely to be asked to commit to three short-term political goals: open, secure borders across the region following European standards; further regional stabilisation through the strengthening of institutions and the rule of law; and assistance to Albania and Macedonia, specifically in the areas of border security and smuggling prevention."The alliance initiates regional co-operation, after which it will become clear that the Balkan countries are responsible for their own borders," the paper quoted a Brussels-based diplomat as saying. NATO's approach is fully supported by the EU, which uses its CARDS programme and other funding instruments to address border issues in the region."The stability of the Balkans is impossible without the security of the borders, a serious fight against organised crime and all types of smuggling, and in Macedonia's case this is the greatest challenge,"  Dnevnik  quoted an unidentified senior NATO diplomat as saying. The problems between Albania and Macedonia -- which, together with Croatia, aspire to NATO membership -- would likely be discussed at the conference. 
  Wolfowitz: US Not Seeking Immunity by Disapproval of ICC  20/05/2003 The American government's disapproval of the International Criminal Court has nothing to do with protecting US citizens who violate the rules of war, US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 20/05/03 During a visit with American peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Friday (16 May), US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz worked to clarify why Washington is seeking immunity for US citizens from prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC)."The United States is not seeking immunity for its people if they commit war crimes. 
 Ankara's human rights reforms may be taking away the separatists' only trump card.  By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 20/05/03 In April, the head of the Kurdistan Democracy Congress (KADEK), Osman Ocalan, called on Kurds to rise in rebellion in major metropolitan areas. 
 But that day has come and gone with no visible sign of any uprising. Turkey's Kurdish problem turned bloody when members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) carried out attacks in 1984 in the southeastern part of the country. 
 A Return to the Village Project was launched last year to relocate people displaced from their villages. Turkey's desire to become a full member of the EU has also led to human rights' reforms that authorise broadcasting and education in Kurdish. 
 If the Turkish government follows through on its pledges, it will take away the human rights trump card that PKK/KADEK has long held. 
  Del Ponte Hopes Belgrade, UN Tribunal Entering New Era of Co-operation  20/05/2003 The UN war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor sounded a rare note of optimism after meeting with top Serbia-Montenegro officials.  (BBC - 20/05/03; AFP, AP, CNN, VOA, RFE/RL, Radio B92, Serbian Info - 19/05/03)Belgrade and the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague are entering a new era of co-operation, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, said Monday (19 May). 
 Last year, he managed to evade at least two attempts by SFOR troops to apprehend him. On Tuesday, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte called on Karadzic to give up voluntarily, voicing confidence he will end up in The Hague one way or another. 
  NGOs Filling Gaps in Helping Unemployed  27/05/2003 Because Bosnia and Herzegovina lacks employment agencies for people in search of jobs, some NGOs here are providing that service.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 27/05/03 The thousands of unemployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) often have little official recourse other than to register at their local employment bureau and wait. 
 "He researched it perfectly, and he's already negotiated three contracts with buyers."Altius adviser Marija Milovic said the point is to get their clients thinking about what is feasible here. 
 Speaking at a press conference on developments in Serbia following the recent 42-day state of emergency, he said Belgrade and the ICTY had agreed for the first time on two-way co-operation. During a recent visit to Belgrade, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said some war crimes suspects could be tried by local courts once Serbia adopts the needed legislation. 
 Two days later, about 300 men who had sought refuge in a hospital were transported under army guard to the Ovcara farm outside of town, where they were beaten by soldiers for several hours. 
 In a number of villages, especially on the remote Rhodep Mountain, the inhabitants subsist mainly on goat yogurt. 
 Even after a decade of economic crisis and deteriorated health services in this country, these villages boast of a good number of centenarians. 
 "Bulgaricus can grow only in Bulgaria, elsewhere it mutates," explains Georgi Georgiev, manager of a company that handles research and production of health food. 
 Steiner took up his Kosovo job following a landmark general election in November 2001 that led to democratically elected institutions in the province -- a president, a government headed by a prime minister, and a 120-seat assembly. In a recent statement before the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, Steiner said the focus of the international community's efforts in Kosovo is now the transfer of responsibilities to provisional institutions. 
  Dubrovnik Declaration Sets Stage for Improved Scientific Research Co-operation  29/05/2003 The COST conference, held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, set the stage for better scientific and technical co-operation among member states and institutions.  (EU, HINA - 27/05/03)An intergovernmental organisation aiming to promote co-ordinated scientific and technological research in Europe completed its one-day ministerial conference in Croatia's coastal town of Dubrovnik on Tuesday (27 May), adopting a declaration that sets the stage for better co-operation among member states and institutions. European Co-operation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST) was established by 19 European states in 1971. 
 Its goal is to promote the co-ordination of nationally funded research on a European level. 
 The two organisations signed a memorandum of understanding, under which the ESF will act as the legal entity providing and managing COST's administrative, technical and scientific secretariat. ESF Secretary General Enric Banda said the synergy between the two bodies would pave the way towards the creation of a European Research Area. Since 1971, COST has launched hundreds of initiatives, many of which have already been completed. 
 Of the Southeast European countries, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro are all members of COST and have been involved in various scientific and technical research actions. According to the Dubrovnik declaration, COST should continue to lend support to non-member countries, including in the Western Balkans. Croatia, for example, has been involved in a number of different projects, including one focusing on the improvement of groundwater resource utilisation in coastal aquifers, and another on artwork conservation by laser. Addressing the forum, Mesic said COST programmes had played an important role in the development of science and technology in his country. 
 It was backed by the leftist opposition, which says it might call for a new vote soon. The move was rejected by a 129-104 vote with three abstentions, with 236 of the MPs in Bulgaria's 240-seat parliament in attendance. 
 Rather, the driving force is the ambition to get a good education, find an adequately paid job and embark on a career. The poll of 1,600 young people is part of a broader, co-ordinated effort being conducted in Montenegro, Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 The results are intended to serve as the basis for developing national policy. Project co-ordinator Dragan Popadic points to several interesting aspects of this research. 
 The mysterious book, consisting of six plates made of 23.82-carat gold, measures only 4.5 by 5 centimetres. 
 Worldwide there are approximately 30 pages from such Etruscan "books", according to Elka Penkova, who heads the museum's archaeology department. Typically, the golden plates were put on the chest of deceased people to represent a "road map" for the soul in its journey through eternity in search of the deities. 
 The general secretary would be a BiH Ministry Council member, and an executive body would be formed to carry out instructions from the BiH presidency. The military officials in each entity expressed their determination to implement these reforms. The meeting confirmed the country's determination to join the PfP programme and to take measures towards further European integration. 
 Solana arrived in Pristina on Wednesday (4 June), in a bid to drum up support for the talks."Thessaloniki is a summit about how to get people of this region closer to the EU, and also a summit about how the people of the region can get together with each other," he said Thursday during a joint news conference with UNMIK head Michael Steiner. But Solana's visit was overshadowed by an incident in the central Kosovo village of Obilic, in which a three-member Serbian family was murdered and their house set on fire. 
 "I consider myself an international person and wanted to work for an American company overseas. 
 Then I found out about the opportunity to work in BiH through a newspaper ad in New York City," she said. 
 He added that the move raised doubts about the capacity of Montenegro's judicial system to handle complicated cases, specifically those dealing with human trafficking. Massari's remarks followed a statement Friday by the US Embassy in Belgrade, urging authorities to continue the investigation."The US government is deeply disappointed that, after a lengthy judicial investigation, the municipal prosecutor has closed the recent sex trafficking case without issuing any indictments," the embassy's statement said. 
 He returned to the Vatican on Monday (9 June) after a five-day, five-city trip, his third to Croatia since the country declared independence. 
  Bulgaria, Turkey Discussing Power Supply Resumption  10/06/2003 Turkey suspended Bulgarian electricity imports in April, charging the country had failed to meet its commitments under a power-for-infrastructure agreement. 
 After 12 hours of talks on Monday (9 June), they said negotiations on the concrete parameters of the deal are to resume in ten days. The Turkish Electricity Trade and Contracting Inc (TETAS) suspended Bulgarian electricity imports on 21 April, alleging that the country had failed to meet its commitments. 
 Under the agreement, Turkey was to import 33.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity from Bulgaria, worth about $1.5 billion, over a ten-year period lasting through the end of 2008.In exchange, Turkish companies were to take part in the construction of the Upper Arda hydropower dam and the Maritsa highway, for $300m and $220m respectively. Aiming to resolve the stalemate, Bulgarian Energy Minister Milko Kovachev and Regional Development Minister Valentin Tserovski travelled to Ankara on Monday for talks with Turkey's Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Hilmi Guler, and other officials. 
 According to Kovachev, any change in the price at which Bulgaria sells its electricity to Turkey -- currently 3.5 eurocents per kilowatt hour -- would be reflected in the volume of Bulgarian investment in the two infrastructure projects. Electricity exports are a key source of revenue for Bulgaria, which received about 250m euros last year from the export of 6.2 billion kilowatt hours to countries in the region. 
  US Defence Secretary Thanks Albania for Support in Iraq, Afghanistan  11/06/2003 US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld held talks with senior officials in Tirana, pledging continued high-level training and exercises to help Albania on its path to full NATO membership.  (Washington Post - 11/06/03; Washington File, DefenseLink, AP, AFP - 10/06/03)During a brief visit to Tirana on Tuesday (10 June), US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld thanked Albania for supporting the global anti-terror campaign and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Albania was among the ten NATO candidate countries in the so-called Vilnius Group that signed a letter in February in support of the US stand on Iraq. 
 "In hot areas of the globe where [the war on terror] is being fought for peace and democracy, Albania is carrying out its duty there."Rumsfeld said he and Majko had discussed "Albania's interest in the Membership Action Plan for NATO and our joint interest in having Albania proceed along the path towards full NATO membership over the years ahead". 
 He pledged that the United States will continue to provide high-level training and exercises to help Albania on its path to full NATO membership. Asked about the likelihood of US military bases being set up in Albania, Rumsfeld said the discussion with his Albanian counterpart focused on "the possibility of exercises and training co-operation, but we did not get into any detailed discussions beyond that".Stressing that Albania considers the United States a strategic partner, Majko said the two countries were currently conducting joint military exercises "of a very specific but also very confidential nature" and that these would be followed by others in the future."Albania has lined up alongside the United States in the global challenge of our times -- the fight against terrorism and the dictatorial regimes nourishing it -- as a partner willing to carry out its duties among the large family of civilised nations," Majko said. In talks with senior officials in Tirana, including President Alfred Moisiu and Prime Minister Fatos Nano, Rumsfeld expressed appreciation for the fact that Albania was among the countries to sign a reciprocal agreement with the United States, barring citizens from extradition to the International Criminal Court."The decision to do that was something that the people of the United States, the government of the United States and certainly the men and women of the armed forces of the United States appreciate a great deal," he said. Rumsfeld's visit to Tirana follows that of US Secretary of State Colin Powell a few weeks ago. 
 Powell also conveyed Washington's gratitude for the strong support Albania has given to the US-led campaign in Iraq. 
  BiH Entity Leaders Promise to Clean up Electricity Utilities  12/06/2003 Bosnia and Herzegovina's entity governments have promised to address the problems in the country's three electricity utilities, paving the way for a project that will restructure the electricity sector.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 12/06/03 Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) entity government leaders announced on 2 June that they were establishing controls over the country's three electric utilities, to address and prevent the corruption and inefficiencies uncovered by special auditors last winter. The cleanups are crucial in getting funding for the Power III project, which will restructure electricity utilities throughout the country. 
 BiH needs to have laws in place by the end of the month that would regulate the establishment of a state electricity company and systems operator. Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic said that the entity interior ministry has charged five people in connection with the mismanagement, conflicts of interest and theft uncovered by a special audit released in February. 
 "But I hope that the RS government will put the system under control."BiH's two other electricity companies were also found to have lost significant amounts. 
 The Croatian general has been at large since June 2001, when UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte unsealed an indictment against him for war crimes allegedly committed during an operation in 1995.Gotovina has been indicted for crimes against humanity, chain-of-command responsibility for failing to prevent the murder of civilians, and overuse of weapons against civilian targets. 
 Soon after, the indictment was unsealed. After two years in hiding, Gotovina now says that he recognises the UN tribunal and is ready to talk. 
 A US State Department report lists them among 15 countries that do not comply with minimum standards and are not taking significant steps to do so.  (CNN, BBC, FT - 12/06/03; US Department of State, AP, AFP, Washington File - 11/06/03)The US government has included Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Greece and Turkey among 15 countries that do not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and are not making significant efforts to do so. 
 After a convoy of armoured police cars rushed him away towards Belgrade's central prison, the protests gradually died down. The Hague-based tribunal's indictment charges Sljivancanin with responsibility for the crimes committed at the Ovcara farm near Vukovar. 
 At an Athens conference focused on the way the regional media treats organised crime, Belgian freelance journalist Salvatore Di Rosa said colleagues in Sofia had shown a lack of commitment when he sought to co-operate with them on an investigation related to Bulgaria. 
 Analysing four recent scandals covered by the Bulgarian media, researchers came to the conclusion that the "war of kompromats" leads to loss of confidence among both the media and the public institutions. 
 Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi was invited to take part in the International Economic Forum in Athens last month. 
  US Certifies Serbia-Montenegro's Co-operation with ICTY  17/06/2003 US aid to Serbia-Montenegro is set to continue, now that Secretary of State Colin Powell has certified that the country is co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal.  (AFP, AP, Reuters, VOA, Washington File, Serbian Government, Radio B92 - 16/06/03)US Secretary of State Colin Powell has certified that Serbia-Montenegro has met the requirements for unlocking frozen US aid to the country. 
 "It is a result of the co-operation which was established with the US administration over the past few months in an effort to overcome various obstacles."On Friday, Serbian police arrested a key war crimes fugitive, Veselin Sljivancanin, indicted by the ICTY for alleged complicity in the 1991 Vukovar massacre, in which around 200 non-Serb civilians were killed. 
  Greece Launches Unprecedented Security Measures for EU Summit  18/06/2003 As senior officials, national leaders and members of 32 European country delegations prepare for the upcoming three-day summit in Thessaloniki, the host country is launching what it describes as its biggest security operation ever.  (Reuters, BBC - 17/06/03)Greece has launched an unprecedented security operation to ward off any possible threats from land, water and air during the EU summit, which will be held from 19 June to 21 June outside its northern city of Thessaloniki. 
 On Tuesday (17 June), the government started deploying thousands of police and army troops as well as surface-to-air missiles and naval ships in the vicinity of the event, whose main venue will be at the Porto Carras resort on the Halkidiki peninsula."This is the biggest security operation that has ever been designed with the participation of all of the country's armed forces," Reuters quoted Greek police spokesman Lefteris Economou as saying. 
 Dozens of navy frigates, coast guard speedboats and frogmen began sealing off the area of the three hotels in the Porto Carras Hotels Complex on Tuesday. 
 Riot police have been deployed to ensure that expected street protests do not sour the event, while about 2,000 police are to be positioned along the road leading from Thessaloniki's Macedonia airport to the seaside hotel. 
 To make sure it is prepared for the worst, Greece is keeping 33 public prosecutors on stand-by, should the need arise to process arrests. Authorities say at least 60,000 demonstrators are likely to arrive in Thessaloniki, and are expected to stage protests during the summit. But demonstrators promise more than 100,000 people, who will commit acts described by one as "social disobedience".While protesters' access to the Porto Carras resort will be blocked off, there will be no restricted zones in Thessaloniki."We are an open, multicultural city and will welcome demonstrators," Northern Greece Minister Giorgos Paschalidis said. Authorities view the EU summit as a key test before the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. 
 Turkey became the first country to sign the Refugee Rights agreement in 1951 and continues to be a very popular with illegal immigrants because of its easy access to the Greek Islands and the rest of Europe. Turkey is a bridge between Europe and Asia, and therefore has become a transit country for refugees wanting to immigrate illegally to Europe. 
 During the first four months of 2003, 13,716 people were apprehended by security forces while trying to illegally enter or exit the country. Most illegal refugees, if not caught by security forces, die while trying to cross the sea in small vessels or while travelling under lorries. 
 The summit could end up being the most significant since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.  By Athanassios Papandropoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 20/06/03 On Friday (20 June), Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis will face one of the most important European summits since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. 
 Convention President Valery Giscard d'Estaing characterised the process as a "mixture of hope and fear sprinkled over with a little dream powder". 
 There can be up to 736 seats in parliament. In Thessaloniki, the European Commission will present to Bulgaria an option for closing the financial chapters of the EU  acquis  no later than the beginning of next year. 
 However, principles must be translated into concrete action.  Analysis by Athanassios Papandropoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 23/06/03 The recent history of the Balkans provides a challenge for the EU. 
 He beatified Ivan Merz, a Catholic theologian, and appealed for forgiveness for the Catholic Church's role in a massacre of over 2,000 Orthodox Serbs during World War II."From this city, marked in the course of history by so much suffering and bloodshed, I ask almighty God to have mercy on the sins committed against humanity, human dignity and freedom, also by the children of the Catholic Church, and to foster in all the desire for mutual forgiveness," the pope said during the mass at the monastery. In pre-war times, Banja Luka was home to a Croat community, numbering 80,000. 
 Today, the city is inhabited by 300,000 Bosnian Serbs, while Croats and Muslims total about 15,000.The pope was greeted at the airport by the members of BiH's tripartite presidency and by Paddy Ashdown, the top international envoy in the country. The Catholic bishop for the region, Franjo Komarica, said he hoped the papal visit would encourage more Croats to return to their former homes in the Bosnian Serb entity. Urging reconciliation and forgiveness, John Paul II called on the people of BiH to put their differences behind them and work to build a lasting multiethnic society. 
  Greece Wary of Terrorists as Olympic Games Approach  24/06/2003 With the Olympics scheduled to take place in Greece next summer, authorities are watching for any signs of potential terrorist activities in the country.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 24/06/03 Last month's al Qaeda attacks in Riyadh and Casablanca are the latest incidents of terrorist activity in the Mediterranean region. 
 Three years ago, many such immigrants received green cards, sometimes without any significant investigation into their criminal records. 
 The EYP is working in close co-operation with foreign services in the coalition against terrorism as they investigate possible links. Greek authorities are concerned about the possibility of an attack during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. 
 How serious are they?  By Athanassios Papandropoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25/06/03 The goals set for the EU at the Thessaloniki summit were achieved, said Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis at its conclusion. 
 He stressed that the work of the Convention for the Future of Europe was completed, and the draft European Constitution was presented. In Thessaloniki, EU leaders agreed that the constitutional blueprint is a good start for the Inter-governmental Conference, and asked the future Italian presidency of the EU to initiate the treaty procedure at the Council of Foreign Ministers in July. As it stands now, the draft calls for the creation of a long-term European Council president -- replacing the current 6-month rotating presidency; the establishment of an EU foreign minister; a slimmed-down commission; and the reduction of the right of national veto. Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the convention, urged EU leaders to change as little as possible of the constitutional draft. 
  SFOR: Operations Under Way for War Crime Arrests; Rajic Transferred to The Hague  25/06/2003 SFOR has boosted operations to search out war crimes suspects -- targeting former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic -- as former Bosnian Croat militia commander Ivica Rajic was transferred to The Hague Tuesday.  (AP - 25/06/03; ICTY, AFP, UN News Centre, Reuters, CNN, VOA, RFE/RL, B92 - 24/06/03)SFOR confirmed Tuesday (24 June) it is working to locate and arrest war crimes suspects. 
 Ward said SFOR had no information on the whereabouts of indicted Croatian Gen Ante Gotovina, who is accused by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague of war crimes against Serbs in Croatia. On Tuesday, Ivica Rajic was transferred to The Hague, almost eight years after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged him with the 1993 murders of at least 16 Bosnian Muslim civilians and the wanton destruction of property in the village of Stupni Dol in central Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).Rajic, 45, was indicted by the ICTY in August 1995. 
 The village, about 4km southeast of Vares, had an almost exclusively Muslim population of 250 people."When the attack had been completed by the HVO, at least 16 members of the civilian population had been killed. 
 The village was almost totally destroyed and the inhabitants who had not been killed were forced to flee," the UN tribunal said in a statement on Tuesday, confirming Rajic's transfer to the court's detention unit. According to the UN tribunal, at the time the indictment was issued, Rajic was in the custody of authorities in Herceg-Bosna, but was released in December 1995. 
 Pocitelj, with its jumble of medieval stone buildings, ancient tower overlooking the river and its proximity to the seaside, gave artists a quiet and scenic place to work. 
 Garland Williams, of the Washington-based Peace Institute, told the Voice of America that if the army and security force reforms continue -- given further democratic changes -- Serbia-Montenegro could join the PfP in three to four years. 
 Some university graduates serving as officers would be conscripted for 12 months instead of 16 months, and some privates would serve for six months instead of eight months. 
 Suspecting that she may have abused her position,  Guardia di Finanza  conducted a search of Xhema's apartment, office and car. On the day of the search, Xhema called the act "a police job" and said she would continue to go to work as usual. 
 The total income of the company for 2002 was 160m euros, of which 100m euros were appropriated for "operational expenditures", which were never fully explained by the company. Local authorities have been concerned about PTK from the beginning of Xhema's career as the head of the company in 2001. 
  Mental Health Project Taking Cues from BiH Practices  01/07/2003 A regional mental health project within the Stability Pact is looking at BiH's experience in using community-based mental health centres to care for psychiatric patients.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 01/07/03 Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) success in running small centres for people who need psychiatric care, rather than leaving impersonal hospitals to do the job, will be the model for a regional mental health project within the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe."The big difference is that the centre is near the patient, and the professionals can reach the patient at their home. 
 The patient can choose therapies, because the centre is staffed by a multi-disciplinary team, not just doctors and nurses, but also social workers and occupational therapists," said Vesna Puratic, regional manager of the Southeast Europe Mental Health Project. The two-year, 2.2m euro project, which includes Albania, BiH, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro, will start creating these community-based mental health care centres in 2004, after completion of the project's first phase -- establishing human-rights based mental health laws in the countries involved -- at the end of this year. Though BiH is plagued by both a lacklustre economy and a war legacy that includes large numbers of refugees, war veterans and orphans, the country managed to transform its mental health system during the war. 
  Bosnian Miners Hunger for Back Wages  02/07/2003 To get their April pay, miners from Zenica staged a two-day starvation strike.  By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 02/07/03 In an effort to get their April wages and to focus public attention on their poor working conditions, miners from Zenica, a city located 60km from Sarajevo, held a two-day hunger strike in the middle of their mine pit last month. The strike ended after more than 30 hours of dramatic underground discussions with representatives of management and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina government. 
  International Community, EU Call for Solution to Greek Unemployment  03/07/2003 With a new surge of unemployment predicted after 2004, Greece must deal with the problem swiftly.  By Nelly Kapsi for Southeast European Times in Athens - 03/07/03 Greece entered the EU with a major advantage that would allow the country to offset the poor condition of its public finances: according to EU standards, its track record with regard to unemployment was satisfactory. 
 Factors include the modernisation of businesses, a drop in the competitiveness of Greek products in international markets and a concurrent loss of major overseas markets. 
 According to Garganas, the following interventions must be made:the social infrastructure concerning child care should be improved and part-time employment should be encouraged in order to increase female employment;special emphasis should be placed on lifelong training, to reduce long-term unemployment;the conditions of entry into the Manpower Employment Organisation programmes should be reconsidered, as a result of the demonstrably non-existent response to these programmes;the integration of foreign workers into the Greek economy and society should be facilitated, to equalise the terms of competition among companies that employ foreigners and those that don't. The report also calls for reducing the cost of job creation, and for labor, social security and tax laws that encourage formal salaried employment in medium and large enterprises, which are the most adversely hit by the rigidity of the regulations. The outcome of all those proposals remains to be seen. 
 Local officials in Stolac have used stones from the ancient city walls to build 14 crosses in the old town. 
 City authorities refused for months to issue the Islamic community a building permit, and in May 2001, thousands of Serbs rioted during attempts to lay the mosque's new cornerstone. 
 Professor Naci Gorur, chairman of the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Institution Marmara Research Centre, was quoted by the Anadolu news agency as saying that scientists and state officials should discuss measures to be taken against earthquakes rather than waiting for one. Experts studying the seismic structure of the country put the risk of a destructive earthquake in Istanbul at 50 per cent within 20 years, since Turkey is located between the landmasses of Arabia and Eurasia. 
 Failure to take precautions could result in more than 70,000 fatalities, Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna told the  Milliyet  daily. 
 A recent survey of 75 per cent of the city's one million structures found that a quake of 7.5 on the Richter scale would damage 252,000 buildings. 
 Of those, about 25,000 would be flattened, he said. Research conducted by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality suggests that 374 public buildings would be completely destroyed, and 783 damaged, in a quake measuring 7.5. 
 According to the same research, 135 school buildings are at risk of collapsing like the dormitory in Bingol. Turkey has no shortage of legal regulations; what it lacks is the will to enforce these regulations. 
 But MPs rely heavily on a hidden support network of parliamentary staff with the time and skills to research issues, maintain contacts with voters and handle administrative tasks. Unfortunately, parliaments across Southeast Europe lack resources in this area. 
 They lack good libraries or computer networks and are often staffed by an older generation that spent most of its working life during the communist era, when parliaments had a very different role. 
 This is a common model in Western Europe, where jobs as research assistants to MPs -- even on a voluntary basis -- are highly competitive. The project benefits all those involved. 
 MPs gain access to staff who can use the Internet and are enthusiastic about research. 
 Interns learn how parliament really works, helping them in their studies and providing valuable feedback to university courses. 
 Vojin Kovacevic, a law student at Belgrade University and an intern for the DSS parliamentary group, says some of the current parliamentary staff view the interns as a threat -- competition for their own jobs. 
 Although many of the new generation of MPs are very committed to their jobs, other deputies are barely interested, rarely attending plenary sessions and making little effort to research issues or represent voters. Overall, the project is a big success. 
 One particular MP, a lawyer, immediately spotted the law student and asked him to help research the laws of neighbouring and EU countries. 
 The cockpit included instructors, members of the surveillance group and representatives of the countries that took part in the surveillance. The aircraft flight paths were monitored over specially equipped notebook computers. 
 Charges include the killings of 23 often high-profile people since 1975, as well as attempted murders, bombings and armed robberies.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 08/07/03 On 29 June 2002, a bomb went off in the hands of Savvas Xiros as he was trying to plant it in Piraeus. 
  Serbia-Montenegro Hopes Article 98 Decision Won't Spark Consequences  10/07/2003 Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said contacts with the US administration are continuing, following Serbia-Montenegro's provisional decision not to sign a bilateral agreement with the United States concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC).  By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 10/07/03 Following a period of searching for an alternative solution, the government of Serbia-Montenegro decided to line up with those countries that did not sign bilateral agreements with the United States barring extradition of citizens to the International Criminal Court (ICC).No one has pressured Serbia-Montenegro to sign such an agreement, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said. 
 On 2 July, Washington suspended military aid to 35 countries that had not signed immunity agreements. 
 The bilateral agreements Washington has signed are not intended to exempt US citizens from responsibility for war crimes, officials say, because other mechanisms -- such as the Geneva convention and conventions on genocide and crimes against humanity -- already exist. Further complicating the situation is an apparent difference of opinion between Serbia and Montenegro, the two constituent republics of the loose union that replaced the former Yugoslav federation earlier this year. 
 Saying that statements of local officials had been blown out of proportion, Djukanovic called for a more careful approach, adding that it would be beneficial if the EU and the United States were to find common ground on the ICC issue. 
 In May, a poll conducted by the Sofia-based Alpha Research agency found that only about 41 per cent of Bulgarians intended to vote in the local elections. 
 The percentage was lowest in the medium-sized and small towns, where 36 per cent of the respondents said they would definitely cast their vote, and was highest in the villages, at 49 per cent. 
 In Sofia, 38 per cent said they have firmly decided to vote. Before the October 1999 vote, Stefan Sofianski's election as Sofia mayor could be predicted with some certainty. 
 The latter appears the more likely scenario. As a result, competition could be tough, and Alpha Research is forecasting a run-off. 
 That could lead to an even lower turnout, which in turn would make the outcome more unpredictable. In elections over the past 13 years, the majority of voters in Sofia have supported right-wing parties and candidates. Sofianski's party was a member of the UDF-led coalition when he ran for mayor in 1995 and 1999. 
 Like the pollsters, he now believes Sofia's new mayor will be elected in a run-off, and that he will be one of the two final contenders. The UDF candidate, Oresharski, is a former deputy finance minister and a lecturer at the University of National and World Economy in Sofia. 
 After his nomination was announced, he said he wanted to become mayor "because I can propose and realise a more efficient managerial project and turn the town into a European capital of an EU member country".Alexandrov's nomination surprised some, since he is not a member of the BSP and is better known as a banker and financier. 
 Alexandrov now heads Tokuda Bank in Sofia and, like Oresharski, is a lecturer at the University of National and World Economy. 
 Fulfilling the right of every girl to a quality, basic education is the key to promoting true equality between boys and girls and men and women," UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said last month, as the initiative kicked off in Turkey's eastern province of Van. 
 It is now expected to propose suggestions for setting up new investigative committees to focus on the problem of graft, which is estimated to have cost Turkey $150 billion over the years. The commission worked for the past four and half months researching the report. 
 The committee must recommend sending the case to the Court by an absolute majority of at least 226 votes, out of the total 550 seats in parliament. The graft commission has no executive power, and is limited to reporting its findings to parliament. 
 More than 40,000 people went missing after the wars in the former Yugoslavia."The time has come to talk about everything that happened in this area," Mikerevic said during his address at the memorial site in Potocari, just outside Srebrenica. 
 They remain at large. Friday's commemoration was the first at which identified victims were buried at the Potocari site. 
 Count Amedeo Preziosi (1816-1882) of Malta belongs to the great family of the Romantic school of traveling artists drawn by the mirage of the Orient, its brilliant colours and picturesque scenes. Preziosi enjoyed success and appreciation during his lifetime, with his watercolours exhibited by Prince Carol I of Hohenzollern-Siegmaringen and reproduced in illustrated magazines such as  The Illustrated London News  and  Le Monde Illustre . 
 As a young man, he ignored his father's ambitions and trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, later departing for Istanbul, where he made a series of drawings for the British ambassador. 
 Capitalising on his excellent knowledge of oriental languages, Preziosi worked as a translator for the British and Greek Embassies, and it was in this capacity that he seems to have made his first contact with Romanian officials. 
 In 1868 and 1869, he made two trips to Romania, invited by Prince Carol I. The Romanian prince, delighted with his watercolours, organised a nine-day public display in the halls of the National Museum. 
  EU Agricultural Reforms Can Help Global Markets  16/07/2003 The recent agreement to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy has obvious shortcomings, but it is progress in the right direction.  Analysis by Athanassios Papandropoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 16/07/03 Following weeks of intense negotiations, EU farm ministers agreed on 26 June to a deal to reform the EU's system of agricultural subsidies and price controls, known as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). 
 Both financial institutions can buy up to 40 per cent of INSIG's shares. Another company being considered for the privatisation process is Albtelekom, the fixed telephone service company, which will also become the country's 3rd mobile operator. 
 Disputes over pricing and the amount of gas delivered to Turkey through the $3.4 billion undersea pipeline require further discussion, both sides agreed. Turkey is a major customer of Russia's state-run gas company, Gazprom, and a gateway for exports to western and eastern markets. 
 One cubic metre of Blue Stream gas is $1.50 more expensive than natural gas purchased elsewhere, Guler says. Blue Stream is the world's deepest undersea pipeline. 
 About 360 km of the 446km pipeline travels at a depth of 2,100m below the surface of the Black Sea. Last month, both sides decided to take the case to international arbitration, but discussions were revisited again earlier this month. 
  Green Cards in Greece Can Be Costly for Non-EU Foreigners  23/07/2003 Lawyers and consulting firms in Greece are making money from those from non-EU countries who want to stay in the country.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 23/07/03 Thousands of foreigners in Greece are paying consultants to save them from the trouble, risk and red tape involved in applying for a green card. 
 Although the official deadline for green card applications expired two weeks ago, the agencies are still full of people. 
 The price they pay for a green card is between 90 euros and 150 euros. Going to an agency saves a trip to the Prefecture Council and also prevents procedural mistakes that can lead to an application being rejected. 
 A classic error involves the number of workdays needed before applying for the green card. 
 The instructions that the Prefecture Councils give are clear, but most immigrants cannot read Greek and few if any public servants speak Arabic, Afrikaans, Turkish, Albanian, Bulgarian, Romanian or other foreign languages apart from English. Immigrants found without a green card are immediately arrested and await deportation. 
 The general secretary of the Athens Lawyers Society, Dimitris Vervesos, said in a recent interview that about 200 lawyers in Athens alone provide services to foreigners, and "most of them are doing a good job." 
 More than 2,500 villagers are expected to benefit from the land if Turkey succeeds in clearing it. According to a report released last September, more than 100 million mines have been laid in 64 countries. 
  New Democracy's Popularity Sparks Cabinet Changes in Greece  24/07/2003 Facing serious competition as next year's election approaches, Prime Minister Costas Simitis has established five rules for his government.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 24/07/03 Following the recent changes in his cabinet, Prime Minister Costas Simitis called for a meeting of the ruling party PASOK's new executive office. 
 This will happen before the upcoming elections. Stock market files between 1998-2000 will be opened for PASOK members of parliament, as well as those of their spouses, in order to show that they have nothing to hide. Auditors will be able to open up personal bank accounts. Ministers, members of parliament, mayors, prefects and governors will be barred from stock market trading. Members of parliament will not be able to own offshore companies. The announcement was greeted with objections from non-PASOK members of parliament. 
 People are avoiding exposure to the hot sun, while the heat is sparking fires all over the country.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 25/07/03 With temperatures rising to more than 37 degrees centigrade, the hot season in Albania is creating a lot of problems. 
 Kids find a refreshing haven in the city's fountains. 
 Swimming pools in Tirana's suburbs are always full. The first heat victim came from Kukes. 
 A 20-year-old man died after staying out in the sun for too long. Temperatures at the peak of the hot season vary from 37 degrees to 39 degrees centigrade. 
 During July, nearly 650 hectares of woods have burned. Forestry specialists are concerned because the hot season and the threat of fires are expected to continue into August. 
  Athens Announces Imminent Suspension of the Schengen Treaty  25/07/2003 In one year, Athens will host what is considered the greatest athletic event in the world. 
 Security issues have led Greek authorities to examine all ways to safeguard the Olympic Games.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25/07/03 The Olympic Games in Athens pose a major challenge for Greece. 
 The asymmetric threats of international terrorism, transnational organised crime, and illegal immigration are the main problems confronting authorities one year before the Games. Greece's Ministry of Public Order is responsible for organising the police force in Athens. 
 Athens wants to create an environment of safety for Greeks, visitors and members of the International Olympic Committee. Of all the problems facing organisers, the threat of international terrorism is the one that has attracted the greatest interest on the part of the Greek government. 
 It must also recover from an eight-point deficit in the polls.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 28/07/03 Nine and a half months -- that's how long the government has to reverse the economic downturn in Greece before voters have the opportunity to elect a new set of leaders. 
 UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte believes Mladic is hiding in Serbia. The commentary in  Oslobodjenje  coincided with a letter from the Office of the High Representative and the OSCE presence in BiH to top RS officials, voicing concern about lack of signs that the entity would meet a six-month deadline, set in March, for disclosing the fate of the victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and the whereabouts of their bodies. 
 The international officials also reminded the RS authorities of their obligation to co-operate on other war crimes issues, including the search for indictees -- most importantly, Karadzic and Mladic. During del Ponte's recent visit to Banja Luka, the entity's leaders promised to improve co-operation with The Hague and renewed calls for fugitives to surrender. 
  Improvements in Greece's Refuse Management Are Necessary  29/07/2003 Revamping the way Greece handles its refuse could be a boon to the environment.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 29/07/03 Greece leads the rear guard within the EU with regard to refuse management. 
 The very next day, residents of these areas, supported by their mayors, organised a mass demonstration to show their unwillingness to host the sites. Few have suggested reasonable alternatives. 
 The Laboratory of Heat Conductivity and Environmental Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki has found a possible solution, though it is one that requires planning and money to implement. 
 Currently, the amount a family pays for garbage collection is included in its electricity bill and is based on the size of its house. 
 Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, the leader also pledged further co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. Zivkovic said the extensive police operation, dubbed Sabre, which was launched following Djindjic's murder on 12 March has helped turn Serbia-Montenegro into the cleanest post-communist country in Europe, though he acknowledged that corruption remains a problem. Operating under a six-week state of emergency, police questioned more than 10,000 people suspected of involvement in the assassination or of having links to organised crime. 
 However, the key suspect, Milorad Lukovic, remains at large. During his visit to Washington, Zivkovic met with key US officials, including Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. 
 As to Kosovo's status, he said the issue would be resolved through "negotiations between Belgrade, Pristina, Washington, Brussels and New York". 
 According to Vukcevic, the principal case will be the alleged murder of approximately 200 Croats at the Ovcara farm near Vukovar in November 1991. 
 Government officials view the bill as a major step towards reconciliation and peace. The legislation was adopted on Tuesday (29 July) with the support of 356 lawmakers in Turkey's 550-seat assembly, in which the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has a majority. 
 The United States, which along with Turkey considers the PKK a terrorist organisation, has warned that it would use military force against the rebels if they do not leave northern Iraq after the amnesty comes into force. Outgoing US Ambassador to Turkey Robert Pearson was quoted earlier this month as saying that Washington's plans concerning the rebels were on stand-by, in anticipation of the Turkish Parliament's adoption of the amnesty bill."One of the visions that all of us, Turks and Americans, have for Iraq, is an Iraq that has no connection with terrorists or terrorist organisations," the Associated Press quoted US Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman saying in an interview on Tuesday. Ankara hopes the new law and other rights reforms Turkey has recently endorsed will also enhance its EU membership bid. 
 He described the official visit to Washington as confirming his earlier belief that bilateral relations are the best in 50 years."Our relations are improving in all fields, and we can soon expect a new chapter of Serbian-US relations, based on a strong strategic partnership and alliance," Zivkovic said. 
 Zivkovic said he understood the US position, considering the country's military engagement in many regions, but also expects Washington to grasp Serbia-Montenegro's specific situation."It would be hard to explain to the local public why we extradite our citizens to The Hague and simultaneously sign the agreement barring extraditions of US citizens -- many people would consider it a double standard," he said. However, Zivkovic added, Belgrade has not made a final decision on the US request, and the issue does not affect Serbia-Montenegro's entry into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme (PfP). 
 Especially significant, according to Zivkovic, was the meeting with Boeing representatives, which focused on strategic co-operation between the company and the Serbian flagship air carrier, JAT. 
  Croatia Tackles Fan Violence at Football Matches  31/07/2003 With hooliganism on the rise among some Croatian football fans, the government is proposing use of the British model to eliminate violence at games.  By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 31/07/03 Croatian officials have decided to stop the violence that has increased recently during events in which Croatian national teams are competing. 
 The decision was made after two incidents abroad. A month ago, Croatian hooligans completely destroyed the Kranj swimming pool in neighbouring Slovenia, site of the European water polo championship. 
 Just a few weeks later, Croatian and Serbian football fans confronted each other in the quiet Swiss town of Kriens. 
 The formerly notorious British hooligans have calmed down, leading to less police intervention. But many Croatian football fans are dissatisfied with the plan. 
 They argue that the sanctions are too strict, and that the government is trying to destroy the football subculture. 
 It's special because it brings people closer together."This was at least physically so at the City Island campsite in Bihac. 
 Awaiting them were rows of yellow camp tents, and a few dozen personal tents next to parked cars with plates from all over Europe. About 800 people registered for the three-day regatta this year, said Aida Sabljakovic, an expert associate with the Una-Sana Canton tourist office."It's the strongest tourist product, not just for our canton but for all of the Federation and for BiH," she said. 
 One American said he liked last year's embassy team so much that he had to come back."Overall the programme has been fabulous," said David Ingerson, who now lives and works in Washington. 
  Bosnian Serb Gets Life Sentence For War Crimes  01/08/2003 Milomir Stakic, a Bosnian Serb doctor and former mayor of Prijedor, has been held responsible for thousands of killings and deportations, as well as for orchestrating the creation of a network of prison camps.  (The Independent, Electronic Telegraph - 01/08/03; ICTY, UN News Service, AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC, CNN, VOA, Radio B92 - 31/07/03)The UN war crimes tribunal has sentenced Bosnian Serb Milomir Stakic to life in prison after convicting him of extermination, murder, persecutions and deportation of non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
 However, the former mayor of Prijedor was acquitted of genocide, the most serious charge. 
 The life sentence is the first the court has handed down in its ten-year history."The primary aim was to displace the non-Serb population in order to achieve the vision of a pure Serbian state," presiding Judge Wolfgang Schomburg said on Thursday (31 July), reading out a summary of the court's ruling. The trial chamber held Stakic, a 41-year-old medical doctor, responsible for more than 1,500 killings and the deportation of at least 20,000 non-Serbs, as well as for orchestrating the creation of a network of prison camps at Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje in 1992, where Muslims and Croats were held in brutal conditions and subjected to torture, rapes, sexual assaults and beatings. But the judges said they could not come to the conclusion that Stakic or others had the "necessary specific intent" to characterise his conduct as genocide or complicity in genocide."Despite the comprehensive pattern of atrocities against Muslims in Prijedor in 1992, that have been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and without detracting from its gravity, the trial chamber has not found this to be a case of genocide," said the judge. 
 He was indicted on eight counts of genocide or complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war."The trial chamber is convinced that there was a persecutorial campaign based on the intent to discriminate against all non-Serbs or those who did not share the plan to consolidate Serbian control and domination of the Municipality of Prijedor," Schomburg said. 
 Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, she is already regarded by many as a saint.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 04/08/03 Mother Teresa, who was of Albanian origin, died in Calcutta in 1997 at the age of 87 after a life devoted to caring for the poor and sick. 
 Minister of State Blendi Klosi, who heads the commission, says these will include conferences and national symposiums, the publication of books and albums concerning her life, the promotion of new documentary films and several concerts."Albania plans to put a statue of Mother Teresa in one of the squares of Tirana," said Klosi. 
 The capital's international airport, central hospital and a city square already bear her name. The special commission has also proposed that President Alfred Moisiu honour the Missionaries of Charity, which Mother Teresa headed, and also proclaim October 2003 through October 2004 as a Jubilee Year. Meanwhile, following protests by Albanian intellectuals, plans by the Macedonian government to erect a monument in Rome have been cancelled. 
 Albanians petitioned Rome Mayor Valter Veltroni, and asked the help of the Holy See to stop the initiative. At issue was a proposed inscription in Cyrillic that would have referred to Mother Teresa as a "daughter" of Macedonia. Born in 1910 to an Albanian family in Skopje, Mother Teresa lived for more than 17 years with her mother, sister and brother in Tirana. 
  Race Against Racism in Greece  04/08/2003 A bill introduced by the justice ministry aims to put an end to racial and other discrimination in both the public and private sectors.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 04/08/03 In the past, there have been reports of hotels in Greece that do not accept "coloured" people and of employers who refuse to hire them. 
 Some hospitals, meanwhile, have been known to deny treatment to non-Christians and to the disabled. The justice ministry is now working to end that by introducing a bill, drafted with the help of the ministry of labour and social insurance, which mandates equal treatment of people regardless of their ethnicity, race, religion or other persuasion. 
 The new measures have become especially urgent since during the last decade, Greece has become an international node for immigrants from the Balkans, ex-Soviet states and Asia. The proposed law is likely to have a wide application. 
  Croatia's Racan Says Most Fires Caused by Negligence  04/08/2003 Downplaying rumours of a concerted action by arsonists, Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said carelessness was the main culprit in the rash of fires that has erupted along the Adriatic coast.  (AFP - 02/08/03; HINA, AFP, Croatian Information Centre - 01/08/03; Reuters - 31/07/03)Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan says negligence has caused hundreds of fires in the country following its worst drought in 50 years. 
 Visiting affected areas on Friday (1 August), Racan told reporters more than 300 fires had erupted along Croatia's Adriatic coast -- a favoured tourist destination -- in recent weeks. In cases in which the cause has been established, 80 per cent were the result of carelessness, the prime minister said, adding there was no real evidence at this point to suggest a concerted action by arsonists. 
  Stolen Cars Remain a Problem in BiH  05/08/2003 Media reports in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro have shown a need for better co-operation among regional police authorities in dealing with car theft rings.  By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 05/08/03 A recent article in the Sarajevo daily  Oslobodjenje  launched a flurry of investigative reports into the problem of organised car theft. 
 Among other things, the reports have uncovered a lack of effective communication between police authorities in the different countries of the region. According to the  Oslobodjenje  sources, several cars stolen in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) were later found registered with new license plates issued by police in Montenegro. 
 But the police have held the requests for months in their desks without results," Biser said. Well-organised criminal groups in Serbia-Montenegro steal cars in BiH using a "wish list" of black-market buyers from various Southeast European countries, who buy the stolen cars for relatively low prices, Biser explained. 
 The vehicles are then sold in Montenegro, where police issue the new plates. Journalists in Serbia-Montenegro have pressed local police to explain how it is possible to register a stolen car so easily. 
 "The car thefts are part of a serious and profitable organised crime activity that is taking place across national borders in the whole region. 
 They searched 92,000 vehicles, apprehended more than 1,100 suspected criminals for illegal weapons possessions and other crimes, disarmed 12,000 explosive devices, extinguished some 80 fires, and cleaned more than 150 wells. The contingent marked its departure earlier in July in a ceremony held at the military airport near Pristina, which the 650 Russian troops used as their main base since arriving in Kosovo on 11 June 1999. 
 But in four years we have built trust, shared responsibility and accomplishments, which carried us towards peace and prosperity."A spokesman for Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova, meanwhile, said the Russian withdrawal and the restructuring of the KFOR presence should be seen in the light of the progress that has been made."We have our institutions up and running now, ready to take on more responsibilities for the running of our affairs. 
  Athens Begins Month-Long Pre-Olympic Tests  05/08/2003 The test events will take place at the same venues where competitions in the respective sports will be held during the actual Olympics.  (AP, AFP, Athens 2004 Organising Committee - 04/08/03)The Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC) has launched a month-long series of pre-Olympic tests to assess the venues and facilities for next year's summer games and determine any possible changes that might need to be made in the coming months."The lessons learned from these events will allow us to improve our procedures and our way of organisation," ATHOC President Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said Monday (4 August) during a ceremony at the Schinias Olympic Rowing Centre, marking the kick-off of test events in seven sports. All events will take place at the same venues where competitions in the respective sports will be held during the actual Olympics. 
 The four-day event is set to begin Wednesday at the Schinias rowing centre, about 30 km northeast of Athens, with 557 athletes from 45 countries participating. 
 Other test events include archery, canoe-kayak flatwater racing, beach volleyball, cycling, sailing, and equestrian events. Some additional test events, such as softball and wrestling, had to be postponed due to venue delays."I'm sure that the Athens Olympics will be the best in history in most areas," International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge told Greek daily  Ta Nea  on Monday. 
 His organisation, which has been closely monitoring the preparations, has in the past voiced concerns over construction delays and other difficulties."I can now express my complete satisfaction on the progress of preparations for the Games in Athens, progress in all areas is clear," Rogge said. 
 Denis Oswald, the president of the International Rowing Federation and head of the IOC's Athens 2004 inspection team, praised Greece for the progress that has been made in recent months. Security is a key priority for ATHOC, with more than $600m allocated to ensuring the safety of the Games. 
 He died serving the people of Kosovo."Shortly before midnight on Sunday, Menon, 43, and a British officer slowed their patrol car due to rocks on the road between Leposavic and Mitrovica and came under gunfire from concealed gunmen. 
 "Multiple shots were fired into the passenger seat. 
 The British officer, who was driving the car, was not hurt. In a statement on Tuesday, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan condemned the "appalling act", saying that those who committed this "brutal murder" must face justice."The Secretary General is shocked and outraged at the killing of a UN police officer in an attack on a police vehicle in the northern part of Kosovo," the statement issued by a UN spokesman said. 
 "He strongly condemns this appalling act and appeals to all concerned to co-operate with UNMIK in carrying out the investigation into the circumstances of this brutal murder. 
  Albania's Royal Family to Regain Property  07/08/2003 The OSCE Presence in Albania is helping parliament resolve an issue that has generated considerable debate during the years of transition.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 07/08/03 As parliament considers a draft law on restitution, the Albanian government has announced that it will return property belonging to the former royal family, and Prime Minister Fatos Nano has appointed Minister of State Blendi Klosi to deal with the pending issue. A press release from the prime minister's office said that Klosi has been instructed to "follow the needed procedures" for the return of the property, starting with a villa in the western port city of Durres. Much of the family's property dates back to the period 1928-1939, when Ahmet Zogu was king of Albania, and was confiscated following the monarchy's fall from power and the subsequent communist regime. Some media reports have described Nano's move as a political maneuver intended to obtain the support of the Legalist Movement party during a recent vote on two new ministers. 
 His father, the former King Zog, was deposed by the communists in 1946. 
 The Adriatic Sea separates it from Italy. Tadic said the army, which is going through a period of transition, will provide technical assistance and personnel to help out Montenegro's border police, and that police officers will soon begin providing border security in Serbia. 
 Katev, who also left a successful career in the West to take his post in the ministry, said Thursday he would leave immediately if the prime minister accepted Velchev's resignation. 
 A Turkish delegation will travel to Washington on 18 August for discussions. 
  Greek Newspapers Criticise Pre-Olympic Tests  11/08/2003 A series of mishaps marred the first week of testevents for the Athens 2004 Olympics, but IOC officials expressed satisfaction with the overall organisation.  (CNN, Reuters - 10/08/03; Athens 2004 Organising Committee, CNN - 09/08/03; BBC - 08/08/03)Greek newspapers have criticised the organisers of the 2004 Athens Olympics following a series of mishaps during the first week of test events being held this month, suggesting high-levelofficials would likely be penalised. 
 But International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials said they were satisfied with the organisation of the first test event and voiced optimism about the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens."Mistakes have been discovered in the planning of sports events, in hospitality, among volunteers, while communications and crisis management functions didn't work," the normally pro-government Greek daily  Eleftherotypia  said on Sunday (10 August).On Saturday, Prime Minister Costas Simitis called on the Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC) to open an inquiry into a salmonella outbreak that forced the German team to pull out of the World Junior Rowing Championship -- the first of seven pre-Olympic test events under way in Athens. 
 The event had been intended as a test of Athens's new rowing facility. 
 The health ministry says an inspection of the hotel that housed the German athletes uncovered 13 irregularities, and the hotel restaurant's license has been suspended pending further investigation. ATHOC characterised the incident as an isolated one, but pledged that all necessary measures would be taken to prevent its recurrence and hold those responsible into account. Meanwhile, tests of the rowing facilities at the Schinias centre, located about 30 km northeast of Athens, were plagued by high winds. 
 The races began almost two days later than scheduled due to the winds, which caused US and British boats to sink and spurred accusations that a mistake had been made in choosing the site. But the IOC defended the choice, arguing that strong winds were typical for all of Greece during August. According to Greek media, the first test event revealed lapses in the areas of transportation and security. 
 Buses carrying the South Korean and Ukrainian teams reportedly went missing for hours after losing their way from the newly-built international airport to the rowers' accommodations near the Schinias venue. In addition, some security officers were reportedly unable to operate their screening and communications equipment, while volunteers assigned to the rowing competition have withdrawn because of trouble getting to the venue via public transport. ATHOC head Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki and Prime Minister Costas Simitis have called a special meeting to discuss the problems, according to the Greek press. 
 Both reportedly are furious."It is certain that much will change after the test events," Angelopoulos-Daskalaki was quoted as saying. However on Saturday, Denis Oswald, the president of the International Rowing Federation and head of the IOC's Athens 2004 inspection team, expressed satisfaction with the organisation of the rowing championship. 
  Future Tirana: A Mix of Historical Values and Contemporary Standards  12/08/2003 Green zones, expansion of the city's main boulevard and the construction of a multifunctional trade centre are among the highlights of the proposal submitted by Architecture Studio, which won an international competition initiated by Tirana Mayor Edi Rama.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 12/08/03 The French firm Architecture Studio has been chosen for the redesign of central Tirana's after winning an international competition. 
 "Tirana has to preserve its history," Ayache said. Tirana Mayor Edi Rama expressed satisfaction with the proposal, adding that the competition had served to transform the world's view of the capital."We succeeded in bringing three international projects to Albania," he said. 
 Those that occurred after the fall of communism had an impact on the city's structure, significantly affecting the regulatory plan and creating the need for a redesign. 
 The deal benefits not only the state but also the city of Nis, which gets 5 per cent, or 19m euros, and another million euros for each succeeding year. The offered social programmes have been fully accepted, in co-operation with representatives of local governments and trade unions. 
  Macedonia to Host "Dialogue Among Civilisations" Forum  12/08/2003 Later this month, Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski and UNESCO Director General Koichuro Matsuura are sponsoring a regional forum aimed at promoting stability, tolerance and democracy in Southeast Europe.  (MIA - 11/08/03; UNESCO)A two-day regional forum called "Dialogue Among Civilisations" will open in the Macedonian resort city of Ohrid on 29 August. 
  New Sarajevo University Department Using Some Western Methods Successfully  13/08/2003 Higher education is conducted on a more intimate level in Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital. 
 It may be a model for other institutions in the region to follow.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 13/08/03 Sarajevo University's year-old art history department, with its small classes and more personal relationships with professors, stands out in a university system usually viewed as impersonal."The relationship with the professors is closer and friendlier -- they even know our names," said Haris Dervisevic, 20, a first-year student in art history and Arabic, adding that students in the law or economics departments, for example, remain anonymous to their professors. These things are normal in the west, where accessible professors are considered part of a good college education. 
 Mandic also said that though she tried to use her experience as a teaching assistant at Tufts University in the United States, she had to walk a fine line with the students here -- being both friendly and professional -- so they would take her seriously as an authority figure. Another more pressing problem is that the department, which opened last October, doesn't have money or equipment. 
 People would rather have bread on the table than a home computer. 
 Last week, supermodel Eva Herzigova left her yacht to take a walk in the city of Hvar and was immedately followed by reporters and photographers.

  New UNMIK Chief Condemns Kosovo Killings  14/08/2003 Extremists cannot be allowed to undermine the future of Kosovo, newly appointed UNMIK head Harri Holkeri said in a statement following a shooting Wednesday that left two Serb teenagers dead and four others wounded.  (Reuters, FT - 14/08/03; UNMIK, OSCE, AFP, AP, BBC, Radio B92 - 13/08/03)Harri Holkeri, the newly appointed UNMIK head, has condemned a shooting incident Wednesday (13 August), in which unidentified gunmen opened fire on Serb teenagers swimming in a river in the western Pec region. 
 The incident occurred shortly after Holkeri started his first visit to the province before officially taking his post in September."It is a tragedy for Kosovo that four years after the conflict ended, such incidents continue to take a terrible toll on the lives of innocent individuals and on Kosovo's image in the international community," Holkeri said in a statement. According to UN police, a group of teenagers from the village of Gorazdevac were cooling off in the Bistrica River when an unspecified number of attackers hidden in nearby shrubbery opened fire with AK-47 assault rifles. Two Kosovo Serb youths, aged 18 and 19, were killed while four others were injured. 
 Two of the wounded are in serious condition and were flown to a hospital in northern Kosovo by a NATO helicopter, UN police spokeswoman Angela Joseph said. An ethnic Albanian girl sustained minor injuries shortly after the shooting when an angry crowd of about 100 Serbs threw stones in Gorazdevac, but her condition did not require medical care, according to Joseph. Quoting local reports, the  Financial Times  said the swimmers were being guarded by Italian KFOR troops when the incident occurred. A massive search for the gunmen is under way and an international prosecutor has already been assigned to the case. 
 While they could not confirm the identity of the gunmen, UN police sources told the AFP that the attack appeared to have been ethnically motivated."We cannot allow a few extremists, of whatever ethnicity, to undermine the secure and hopeful future that so many have worked to build here," Holkeri said in a statement. 
  Dozens Injured as Earthquake Jolts Greek Island  15/08/2003 Hundreds of tourists have fled to the mainland after a powerful earthquake struck the Ionian island of Lefkada on Thursday, causing widespread damage and injuring at least 50.  (Independent, The Australian - 15/08/03; AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC - 14/08/03)Several strong aftershocks followed an undersea earthquake that rocked the western Greek island of Lefkada on Thursday morning (14 August), injuring at least 50 and causing landslides and damage to roads, houses and businesses. 
 Hundreds of tourists fled to the mainland while many local residents spent the night outside. The quake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale, struck the Ionian Sea island at 8:15 am local time. 
 Officials of the Athens Geodynamic Institute, which monitors seismic activity, said its epicentre lay 14 km under the sea, about 30 km west of Lefkada. 
 With a population of about 22,000, Lefkada was fully packed with Greek and foreign tourists at the peak of the holiday season. According to rescue officials, more than 50 people have been treated in the local hospital or in three other hospitals on the mainland, mostly with head or limb injuries caused by fallen roof tiles or rocks from the massive cliffs surrounding the Lefkada beaches. 
 None of the injuries was said to be life-threatening, though four of the seven people taken for treatment to the mainland Prevaza hospital were said to be in "serious condition".Foreign tourists who sustained injuries as a result of the quake included a Czech, a Scottish couple, a Briton and seven Italians. Only one bridge links Lefkada with the mainland and it was jammed with cars as hundreds of Greek and foreign tourists cancelled their hotel reservations and rushed to leave. 
 "The foreigners stay back, maybe because they can't leave by car."TV reports showed cracked roads and damaged houses, including one tilting on its foundation. Quoting Greek officials, the AFP said 30 uninhabited houses had collapsed, while 50 inhabited ones were seriously damaged. According to Anastasia Kanelopoulou, general secretary of the Ionian Islands regional government, most of the homes that were destroyed were in the north of the island. 
 Greece, which is located in a seismically active region, saw its deadliest quake in recent years in 1999, when 143 people were killed and thousands were left homeless after a 5.9-magnitude quake hit Athens. 
  UN Security Council to Discuss Situation in Kosovo  18/08/2003 Last week's attack on a group of teenagers and children near the village of Gorazdevac left two people dead and four injured. 
 Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic has said he hopes for a new UN Security Council resolution aimed ending violence in Kosovo.  (Tanjug - 18/08/03; AFP, Radio B92 - 17/08/03; UNMIK -- 14/08/03 - 16/08/03)The UN Security Council is due to hold an extraordinary session on Monday (18 August) to discuss the situation in Kosovo following a shooting near the village of Gorazdevac last week that killed two Kosovo Serb youths and injured four others. 
 Harri Holkeri, who is expected to take up his post in September, condemned the attack, saying that UNMIK would not allow extremists of any ethnicity to undermine the security situation in Kosovo. 
 It is stated that we want to carry out lustration and to eliminate certain individuals who held public office in the past. 
 There is not a mystery in this," Batic said. The Democratic Alternative and Democratic Centre have both expressed discomfort with the fact that Batic proposed the new law not in his capacity as justice minister, but rather as the leader of DHSS. 
 Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic has said the latest spate of violence would delay the start of direct talks. In related news, UN police spokesman Derek Chappell confirmed that a new attack took place on a Serb village in the Gorazdevac area on Sunday. 
 Many cargo vessels are being loaded significantly below their capacity so that they do not run aground. 
 Five Bulgarian tugboats with barge convoys remained blocked in Croatia, Hungary and Austria due to low water levels there as well. Warning of the possible suspension of navigation along the Danube, Bulgaria's River Shipping Company said Monday that a total of 18 rapids had emerged in the stretch marking the common border between Bulgaria and Romania. The Danube, the second-longest river in Europe after the Volga, rises in Germany, crosses Austria, Slovakia and Hungary, and forms the Serbo-Croatian border and the border between Bulgaria and Romania. 
 Finally, it enters the Ukraine, flowing into the Black Sea through a large, swampy delta. In Croatia, which is experiencing its worst drought in 50 years, other major rivers have also reportedly reached their lowest levels, sparking concerns about possible electricity shortages. Similar concerns have emerged in Serbia, where the water level of the Danube and other major rivers at the end of July was said to be the lowest in the last 100 years. In late July, the director of Romania's Danube Delta Reservation, Grigore Baboianu, warned ofabout a potentialssible environmental disaster. 
 They know no national boundaries," Jensen said. The Egmont Group was created in 1995 in Brussels, when a number of FIUs from different nations began working together informally, with the goal of boosting support for their respective national anti-money-laundering programmes. Support includes expanding and systematising the exchange of financial intelligence, improving personnel expertise and capabilities, and fostering better communication among FIUs through the application of new technologies. The World Bank, IMF, Interpol, World Customs Organisation, Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors, Asia Pacific Group and the Global Programme against Money Laundering are the main institutions supporting and financing the fight against money laundering. 
 On the domestic side, there have been reports of companies being pressured to finance the campaigns of political parties as a way to strengthen political power and secure a guaranteed financial base. Small parties charge that a deal exists among those in power to keep the issue constantly under the carpet. 
 He also noted the failure of Bulgarian police to clear him in a recent scandal involving photographs that showed him in the company of alleged organised crime figures. Velchev agreed to stay on after consultations with Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, cabinet members and other politicians, and after receiving their vocal support for his tight budgetary policy and efforts to crack down on smuggling. Announcing his decision to stay on in a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday, Velchev also expressed his appreciation for Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov's public statement on 8 August, in which he said the ministry had no information linking the finance minister with individuals of questionable reputation. Velchev, 37, is one of several young Western-educated professionals who joined the cabinet's economic team in mid-2001, leaving behind successful careers in the West. 
  Sighisoara to Host Festival of Ethnic Communities  22/08/2003 The 3rd Pro Etnica Festival will be held from 22 August to 24 August in the medieval walled city of Sigisoara, featuring the music, costumes and traditions of no fewer than 16 ethnic groups in Romania.  By Marian Tutui for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 22/08/03 Sighisoara has been described as the only European medieval walled city that is still preserved. 
 The town's other famous inhabitant was Hermann Julius Oberth (1894- 1989), one of the three founding fathers of rocketry and modern astronautics, along with the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and the American Robert Goddard. 
 In the evening, concerts, theatre performances and folk dances will be offered in the very centre of the city, the Hermann Oberth Square. Keeping in mind the long history of a city where Germans, Hungarians and Romanians have lived together for centuries, one would be hard pressed to find a more appropriate location for a festival celebrating the country's myriad traditions and peoples. 
 The murder weapon was retrieved a short time later. Djindjic, 50, was gunned down by sniper fire as he stepped out of his car in front of his office in Belgrade. 
  Simitis: "My Goals After the Elections"  25/08/2003 Costas Simitis promises regional development and social convergence after the elections, while highlighting the changes that PASOK will make internally to better serve Greeks.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25/08/2003 An interview with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis is not an ordinary occurrence; he rarely speaks with the press. 
 Authorities closed the unit at the weekend, given the plummeting level of the Danube.  (Rompres, International Herald Tribune, Seeurope.net - 25/08/03; Washington Times - 24/08/03; Reuters, AFP - 23/08/03)As the Danube continues to recede, Romania has shut down Unit 1 of its Cernavoda nuclear power plant, blocking further operation of the reactor's cooling system. 
 The level of the Danube dropped another 5cm overnight."The level of the Danube dropped from one day to the next from 125cm to 120cm, which as a result meant a drop in the quantity of water needed for cooling the reactor," AFP quoted Secretary of State for Energy Iulian Iancu as saying. The government has already announced its plans for an increase of between 12 per cent and 22 per cent in electricity, heating and natural gas prices as of 1 September. 
 News of the Cernavoda shutdown sparked concerns about a new electricity price hike. 
 Popescu has dismissed such speculation, saying the government would boost the output of thermal power stations to compensate for the loss of capacity. The unprecedented drought this summer has also caused some hydroelectric power stations to run at a lower capacity, while hydro-meteorological forecasts suggest the level of the Danube will likely continue to recede over the next few days. The river, which shapes the Bulgarian-Romanian border, has dried up in some places, revealing the riverbed. 
  New Stimulus for Business Investments in Greece  26/08/2003 New legislation drafted by the Greek finance minister would provide tax discounts for new businesses.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 26/08/03 Greek Finance and National Economy Minister Nikolaos Christodoulakis is promoting a new bill that would provide generous tax discounts for new businesses starting in September. The bill covers businesses with a share capital of more than 30m euros, although that limit may change. 
 On Monday, it signed a memorandum of co-operation with the organising committee of the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics, with the goal of attracting investors and promoting exports. 
 "These projects should be implemented very carefully since too fast a pace and decentralisation can lead to incompetence and increasing corruption," said Vlatko Gorcev, a spokesman for the party. The two ethnic Albanian opposition parties, the Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP) and the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), expressed objections to the pace of implementation. 
 Milosevic denied involvement in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, while a protected witness who took part in the killings said such a massive and well-organised operation could not have occurred without the approval of top commanders. More than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim boys and men were systematically slaughtered in what is considered the single worst atrocity in Europe since the end of World War II. 
  Zivkovic's Offer to Participate in Peacekeeping Mission Sparks Controversy  27/08/2003 Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic's recent visit to Washington focused on Serbia-Montenegro's possible military involvement in Iraq.  By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 27/08/03 Serbia-Montenegro's Council of Ministers has approved the country's participation in UN peace missions, ending public speculation initiated by Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic's talks in Washington concerning the army's possible engagement in Iraq. 
 Addressing the press in Washington, Powell said that Zivkovic's offer shows the Serbian leadership's responsible approach."I appreciate and welcome the offer, and we will work on it together with our Serbian friends in the following months," said Powell. 
 Two banks -- the US-based Exim Bank and Italy's SACE -- are also backing the project, together with the US and Italian governments."This project will connect the basic elements of the infrastructure: air transport, land, sea and telecommunications," US Ambassador to Tirana James Jeffrey said. 
 The attacks from land and sea also damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in the historic city's Old Town district, a UNESCO world heritage site."Your honours, I am guilty," Jokic said during a special hearing at the UN court in The Hague on Wednesday (27 August).Under the deal, Jokic agreed to plead guilty to murder, cruel treatment, attacks on civilians, devastation not justified by military necessity, unlawful attacks on civilian objects, and destruction or wilful damage to institutions dedicated to religion, culture and education, as well as to historic monuments and works of art and science. A sentencing hearing will take place later this year. 
 Small island hotels have seen a decline in revenue this year, but large, high-end complexes are booming.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 29/08/2003 Large hotel chains have enjoyed considerable success as a result of building new units in locations other than crowded Athens, even though most of the revenue from these units comes only during the summer. 
 All suites and bungalows offer views of the Aegean. At Sounio, just outside of Athens, Grecotel has invested in an amphitheatrically-designed hotel offering 164 rooms and 22 suites, a lounge bar, a pool snack bar and an "internet corner". 
 In addition to its five restaurants, three bars, tennis courts and ample water sports amenities, the hotel also features a panoramic lift for transporting clients directly to the beach, as well as electric cars for transportation on the premises. The tourist industry in Chalkidiki is growing, with two new hotels being developed there. 
 Resolution 1503, which the 15-member Council passed unanimously on Thursday (28 August), reconfirms the strategy for winding up the activities of the two courts. The Council also voted unanimously to reappoint Carla del Ponte as chief prosecutor in the war crimes trials for the former Yugoslavia, but to appoint a separate prosecutor for the Rwanda cases. 
 In all, 27 people have been killed and 220 injured by mines in the area, including many children as well as soldiers patrolling the border. According to experts, the mined zone extends 5km from the border, affecting villages close to the line. 
 Residents of the small village of Kolsh, for example, are in real danger. 
 Their village is located only 10km from the border, putting them in close proximity to the mines. 
 The organisation Care International, with a fund of 615,000 euros, has organised a campaign to inform those in area villages about the risks. At the same time, a number of organisations and companies have placed signs in the "infected areas", warning passers by to take another way and avoid possible incidents. 
 Following a late-night meeting on Sunday (31 August), the council issued a statement calling on police to arrest all those terrorising the population and urging politicians and local authorities to support government efforts to protect the interests of all citizens, regardless of ethnicity. Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski called the meeting following three explosions that rocked Skopje late on Thursday. 
 The Associated Press quoted residents of the Vaksince village, less than 20km northeast of Skopje, as telling Macedonian state television that they were "evacuating" their homes for fear of violence. 
 Some said they had seen armed men in the region. Police sealed off the nearby village of Aracinovo on Thursday as they launched a manhunt for Avdil Jakupi, a militant and suspected ANA member thought to be behind the brief abductions last week of two Macedonians, one of them a policeman. 
 As the search continued Sunday, police were seen reinforcing roadblocks and the area near Vaksince, but officials would not say whether they thought the suspect was hiding there. Backing the efforts of the multiethnic police to arrest "members of those criminal gangs who terrorise the local population", the Macedonian Security Council members called on all politicians and local government officials "to protect the interests of all citizens, regardless of their ethnicity".In other news, Macedonian Army Chief of Staff Metodi Stamboliski left Sunday for an official visit to the United States. 
 However, there's still a year left to go.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 02/09/03 August was the test month for the Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC). 
 Although ATHOC had booked buses, as many as 24 per cent failed to show up. Then there was a problem with seating for the rowing event -- no small thing, since it was this year's world championships. 
 The 700 available seats did not meet even half the demand for fans who expected to be able to purchase tickets on-site. And that was hardly the worst of it. 
 And even though many volunteers were unable to attend, the others pulled through. Athens didn't do all that bad, according to members of the media who had attended the test events of previous Olympic Games. 
 There are always mishaps, and no city is ever ready a year before the actual Games, a spokesman remarked. Nevertheless, Simitis has encouraged his ministers to work more closely with ATHOC to avoid international embarrassment next year. 
 Meanwhile, thousands of Kurds rallied in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, calling on the government to make peace with the rebels."At the present stage it has become impossible to keep up the process of a unilateral ceasefire," the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), now renamed KADEK, said in a statement carried on Monday (1 September) by the pro-Kurdish Mesopotamian news agency, based in Germany."We have made a new assessment of the situation and we are announcing that the unilateral ceasefire is ending as of 1 September, and that the ceasefire can continue only as a bilateral one," the statement read. The PKK led a 15-year armed campaign for self-rule before declaring a truce in 1999 following the capture of its leader, Abdullah Ocalan. 
 Police cars lined the streets and snipers were positioned on rooftops, but no clashes were reported."We want peace, don't push the people into rebellion," the Associated Press quoted a protester, who lost two sons in the conflict, as saying. 
 The next day, the ruling Socialist Party (SP) launched its campaign at the same location, promising to reform local administration and improve the infrastructure in cities. The DP candidate for mayor of Tirana, Spartak Ngjela, said the party would focus on "four main areas where the Socialists have been unsuccessful: fighting poverty, building markets, implementing local governmental competencies and revitalising the cultural life of Tirana".The opposition party, which has criticised the SP for allegedly misusing public funds through investments in infrastructure, pledged to institute transparency. 
 This is the guarantee that the vote for us means power for you," Nano said. He added that reforms addressing decentralisation and infrastructure investments must continue. Tirana Mayor Edi Rama, who is campaigning for re-election, addressed the SP rally and cited accomplishments in improving infrastructure and public services in the capital. The vote is being held in accordance with a new election code. 
 Hundreds of people, mainly women and children, have left their homes in the villages of Vaksince and Lojane. Reuters quoted a senior government official as saying police have not yet attempted to enter Vaksince, where armed and uniformed men had been seen. 
 The changes will be the first in Bulgaria's Constitution since its adoption in 1991.Lawmakers in the 240-seat assembly voted 222-0, with no abstentions, in support of the package of reforms dealing with magistrates' immunity, tenure and mandate. 
 Terzic later had a telephone conversation with Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan, insisting that his comment had been misinterpreted. The Croatian government, however, is not giving up. 
 The troops called for support and police then launched an operation, backed by the army, to neutralise the suspected militants around the village of Brest and Malina Mala."Several members of the armed group have lost their lives because they used weapons while resisting arrest," a police statement said, claiming the operation was a success. 
 The man, identifying himself as Ilir Duraku, said four other civilians were injured during Sunday's raid. Over the past 12 months, the ANA has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in Macedonia, as well as in southern Serbia and Kosovo. Sunday's clash was one of the most serious incidents in Macedonia since the end of the inter-ethnic conflict that shook the country in 2001.Authorities stepped up their presence in the Kumanovo-Lipkovo region last week as they launched an operation outside the village of Vaksince to capture Avdil Jakupi, an alleged ANA leader believed to be behind the brief abduction of a Macedonian police officer and a civilian in late August. 
 The kidnappings were followed by three attacks against government buildings in Skopje. The village of Brest is about 20km north of Skopje and only a few kilometres from Vaksince, but officials declined to confirm that Sunday's operation was specifically targeted at Jakupi and his men. Rising tension over the last two weeks has led many ethnic Albanians, mainly women and children, to leave their homes, fearing new clashes. The defence ministry said representatives of the EU-led stabilisation force EUFOR and the OSCE monitored Sunday's operation."The aim is to deal with armed criminal groups," OSCE spokeswoman Isabelle De Ruyt said. 
 Other public companies are waiting in line.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 09/09/03 Greek Minister of Finance and National Economy Nikolaos Christodoulakis is trying to shape up the banking industry by privatising all state-owned banks by the end of the year. 
 The Public Electricity Company is to undergo its 3rd round of denationalisation; this round is expected to be much more successful than the first two, since the firm's telecom subsidiary, Tellas, is currently number one in the market. The Athens Water Company and the newly founded Public Gas Company are also expected to have shares sold to private investors. 
  Croatian President to Make Historic Visit to Serbia-Montenegro  09/09/2003 Stipe Mesic's one-day visit to Belgrade on Wednesday will be the first by a Croatian head of state since his country declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.  (Electronic Telegraph - 09/09/03; Reuters, HINA, Southeast Europe Online - 08/09/03; Tanjug - 05/09/03 - 08/09/03)Stipe Mesic is due to arrive in Belgrade on Wednesday (10 September), becoming the first Croatian president to visit Serbia-Montenegro since his country declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.Mesic's one-day visit seeks to create "a better climate for the settlement of open issues between the two countries", the Croatian news agency HINA quoted Tomislav Car, an official in the president's office, as saying during a news briefing in Zagreb on Monday. Euro-Atlantic integration, regional co-operation and bilateral relations are expected to be key items on Mesic's agenda. 
 He is scheduled to hold talks with Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, Speaker of the state union's Parliament Dragoljub Micunovic, acting Serbian President Natasa Micic, and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic. Other topics likely to be discussed include further liberalisation of the two countries' visa regimes, refugee returns and the search for those who went missing during the 1991-1995 war that claimed 20,000 lives. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1996. 
 Festival organisers made this year's regional programme -- ten movies from six countries -- the festival's focal point by moving it from afternoon screenings at a local cinema to evening slots at the red-carpeted National Theatre. 
 But since BiH-born director Danis Tanovic won an Oscar for his film  No Man's Land  in 2002, local filmmakers have found that they're not as likely to be ignored by producers. 
 "You don't make a film to get an award," Zalica told the Sarajevo weekly  Dani  after winning the Locarno Film Festival's Silver Leopard. 
 Ankara has asked Washington to crack down on the Turkish Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq. 
 But where will all the money come from?  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 11/09/03 With less than a year remaining before the Summer Olympics, the projected budget for the 17-day event has climbed from 6.5 billion euros to 7.5 billion euros. 
 Commemorative coins, stamps and donations will account for 13.5 per cent. The Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC) worked hard to ensure that the Games have a large number of domestic sponsors. 
 Mondo has given sports equipment; Swatch is taking care of the electronic stopwatches; Panasonic is providing the audiovisual equipment; and Samsung will handle the wireless communications. Initially, the Olympics were expected to be fiscally justified for the government. 
  Macedonia to Get Rid of Illegal Weapons  11/09/2003 Billboards, video spots and a music caravan are among the features of a media campaign aimed at persuading citizens to hand over illegal weapons. 
 Also planned is a caravan of musicians, artists and intellectuals, who will tour the country to promote the disarmament action. The weapons collection process will be carried out between 1 October and 15 December at points in every municipality. 
 Its decision could reshape the future of Turkish politics, potentially reducing the number of parliamentary seats held by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) or even leading to a rerun of the general elections. 
 An alternative would be for the election board to cancel only those votes given to DEHAP; the result would be that the DYP, which failed to meet the 10 per cent national threshold last time around, would have 66 seats in parliament. DEHAP also came under the threshold, garnering only 6.5 per cent of the vote. Even if the Supreme Court rules against DEHAP, the board might still decide that the election results were valid. 
 AKP enjoys a 368-seat parliamentary majority, allowing it to amend the country's constitution. But politicians from the DYP and other parties that did not meet the threshold argue that such a decision would legitimise an illegal act. 
 The ceremony highlighted the fair's theme -- Space Technologies and Robots. The theme was chosen because of rapid developments in this branch of technological research. 
 The US space agency presented some experiments and research projects. In recognition of its contributions to the technology arena, the IEF selected Egypt as guest of honour. 
 According to the interior ministry, the task of the new reservists will be to help resolve existing tensions in a village seen as a hotspot for violence, crime and extremism. The OSCE mission in Macedonia will train and prepare this new security team in Aracinovo. 
 Composed in accordance with the multiethnic structure of the village, the team will consist of 20 ethnic Albanians and two Macedonians. 
  Del Ponte Demands Handover of Top War Crimes Suspects by Year's End  15/09/2003 The war crimes tribunal at The Hague will not close its doors before Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croatia's Ante Gotovina are tried, vows UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.  (Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, HINA - 12/09/03)Embarking on her 2nd four-year term as chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Carla del Ponte has said the surrender of all remaining fugitives is one of her top priorities. The court would not close its doors before Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croatian General Ante Gotovina are tried, said del Ponte, setting the end of 2003 as a deadline for their handover. 
  The Price of Olympic Hospitality in Athens  16/09/2003 With hotel prices during the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics expected to skyrocket, booking a room on a cruise ship could be a good alternative.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 16/09/03 In addition to the excitement of the Games, visitors to Greece during the Athens 2004 Olympics may also be confronted with record-setting hotel prices. 
 The best way to get a cheaper room is to go via a travel agency, which may offer slightly lower prices for extended stays, or to book a room for the full period of 17 days -- the duration of the Games -- for around 6,500 euros. Rooms are cheaper outside Athens, in resorts such as Loutraki. 
 But star ratings won't make much of a difference during the Olympics, when a two-star hotel in the same area will cost a minimum of 1,350 euros. Korinthos and Eretria, cities that are a two-hour drive from Athens, are expected to have prices similar to those of Loutraki. 
 Meanwhile, accommodation on the four-star Rotterdam will cost between 450 and 1410 euros. Other cruise ships that are available for booking are the Oosterdam (five star), the Olympia Voyager and the Explorer, the Aidavita, the Seabourn Pride, the Silver Whisper, the Splendour of the Seas, the World Renaissance (four star), and the Topaz (three star). 
 The parallel restoration projects aim to heal scars left by the conflict in Macedonia two years ago and promote interethnic reconciliation. The church and mosque are both located in a former crisis region in the Tetovo area. 
  Constructions of Olympic Proportions are Here to Stay  17/09/2003 With more than 1 billion euros spent on Olympics-related projects, Greeks want to know which ones they will be able to enjoy in years to come.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 17/09/03 Today, Athens looks like an enormous building site, and residents are asking questions: "Will all these projects be ready on time? 
 The Ymittos Ring Road should also be ready then, enabling motorists to go from the city centre to the airport in 20 minutes. Those without a car or bike will be able to use the new 32km suburban rail service, which connects the airport with the national railroad, the city underground and the main bus lines. 
 Athens' southern end will be serviced by a new tram. 
 The city's underground system, meanwhile, will get five new strategically located stations, as urged by the International Olympic Committee. Taxis, for many the rotten apple of Greek hospitality, are getting a facelift too. 
 The government plans to encourage Athenians to purchase a taxi by offering financial aid of up to 4,500 euros. Bridges and tunnels are also being built around the city to further ease traffic. 
 At the same time, Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni is doing her best to spruce up the aging city. 
 A 5,000-seat stadium will host the country's hopes for its weightlifting "dream team". 
 Other facilities include the 8,000-seat equestrian centre, an Olympic Centre for ping-pong and gymnastics, a centre with beach volleyball and handball facilities, a shooting range, and the press village. Later, most of these facilities will be used as sports halls, cultural centres or government buildings. 
 The Olympic Village, for instance, will be given to 2,292 families after the athletes go home. 
 As of now, 110 of the applicants have been released. The law offers a complete pardon to any KADEK members who can be proven never to have carried out armed attacks on Turkish targets. 
 Most of the detainees were civilian Muslim men, aged 16 to 80, and included mentally handicapped, physically disabled and seriously ill people who had not been charged with any crime. Held in overcrowded cells, the prisoners, whose number reached 760, could not lie down to sleep and were deprived of medical care. 
  Tirana Takes Steps to Calm Ethnic Tensions in Macedonia  19/09/2003 In addition to distancing itself from extremist groups such as the ANA, Albania is taking positive measures to help bring peace and stability to neighbouring Macedonia.  By Orest Erzeni for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 19/09/03 Albania was among the first states to condemn the actions carried out recently in neighbouring Macedonia by armed militants calling themselves the Albanian National Army (ANA). 
 "I speak of Karadzic and Mladic."Echoing an earlier statement by the chief UN prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, Meron stressed that the ICTY would not close before the two fugitives face justice."We will not go out of business before we have tried Karadzic and Mladic and let nobody think that we will go out of business before that, and that they can just sit us out," Meron said. 
 Its two buildings will have the capacity to house up to 100 people. 
 While offering care and services, the centre will also work to reunite trafficking victims with their families or return them to their countries of origin. Also envisioned are public campaigns to raise awareness of the problem of human trafficking. 
 Whatever the outcome of the court proceedings, a dark chapter of Greek history is coming to an end.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 22/09/03 For the past seven months, alleged members of the terrorist organisation November 17 have been on trial in Greece. 
  Turkish Tourism on the Rise  23/09/2003 Fears of terrorism, SARS and war in Iraq all had a negative impact on the tourist season in Turkey. 
 However, the industry recovered in July, which saw a record number of visitors.  By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 23/09/03 Prospects for Turkish tourism, bright in 1996 and especially in 1997, deteriorated in the years that followed because of the threat of terrorism and bad publicity resulting from the 1999 earthquake. 
 Bed capacity usage has reached 100 per cent in Antalya, Turkey's premier resort region, though other well-known resorts such as Bodrum, Marmaris and Kusadisi are still lagging. 
 Representatives of the tourist sector hope that August and September turn out to be record-breaking months. That would alleviate some of the disappointment resulting from failure to meet targets for the season set by the tourism ministry, which ran a worldwide promotional campaign targeting central European countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
 At the start of the season, the ministry estimated that 15 million tourists would spend their holidays in Turkey, leading to $13 billion in revenues. 
 Figures from the tourism ministry show, however, that the overall number of tourists coming from OECD countries declined 8 per cent, while the number of tourists coming from Eastern Europe increased by over 12 per cent, compared to last year's figures for the same period. During the entire 2002 season, around 13.2 million tourists visited Turkey, generating revenues of $8.4 billion. 
 One of Bucharest's main streets, it was known as Podul Mogoshoaiei at the end of the 17th century, when it connected the Old Court in the city with the lakeside palace, located 18km away, of Constantin Brancoveanu, prince of Wallachia (1688-1714). 
 These include the Romanian Atheneum (1888), the Central University Library (1895) and the CEC Palace (1900).The famous road has survived two world wars, powerful earthquakes, and even the dictator Ceausescu's projects to redraw Bucharest along totalitarian lines, which had a negative impact on one third of the city's central area and led to the destruction of 20 churches. 
 Critics argue that some of the architects who encouraged him in his grandiose plans are still at work in the post-communist era, undermining the beauty of the city. 
 But just as a decisive civic reaction halted plans to erect Dracula Park near the medieval town of Sighisoara, residents of Bucharest can preserve their city's architectural heritage. 
  Insider Witness Says Srebrenica Massacre Was Planned  23/09/2003 Momir Nikolic is the highest-ranking Bosnian Serb officer with inside information to testify about the Srebrenica massacre, considered the single worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.  (AP, AFP, VOA - 22/09/03; AP - 19/09/03)A former Bosnian Serb Army captain has testified at the UN war crimes tribunal that the 1995 summary executions of over 7,500 Bosnian Muslim boys and men in Srebrenica were part of a premeditated plan. Momir Nikolic testified Monday (22 September) during the trial of Colonel Vidoje Blagojevic. 
 In return, the prosecution dropped the other charges. Nikolic, 48, is the highest-ranking Bosnian Serb officer with inside information to give evidence on the Srebrenica massacre, considered the single worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.About 30,000 Bosnian Muslims had sought refuge at the UN-declared safe haven of Srebrenica. 
 They were scared." 
 And the all-local textbook committee --12 members from both entities -- removed questionable maps and pictures from Bosnian textbooks, and dealt with wartime history by creating a factual timeline without interpretation."There's no problem with [this presentation of] history," said Canton 8 Education Minister Jozo Maric by telephone from Siroki Brijeg. 
 Stambolic, who served as Serbia's president from 1986 to 1987, was expected to be Milosevic's major rival in the October 2000 presidential election. Serbian police said earlier that five members of a now disbanded special police unit linked to Milosevic's regime had abducted and executed Stambolic. Milosevic has denied all allegations linking him to the murder, claiming he had not considered him a threat to his political career at the time. 
 In an earlier incident, in October 1999, the veteran opposition leader escaped a staged car crash, in which four of his associates were killed. Local media quoted Prijic as saying in a statement on Tuesday that Milosevic had spurred the perpetrators' decision to target Stambolic and Draskovic. 
  Albania to Get 2nd National Airport  25/09/2003 The United Arab Emirates is financing a 22m-euro project to build a new airport in northeast Albania.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 25/09/03 Albania soon will have a second national airport in the northeastern city of Kukes, near the border with Kosovo. 
 The UAE, he said, is also helping with other important projects in Albania."The UAE is ready to finance a part of the road from Durres, the Albanian port city to the northeast, near the border with Kosovo. 
 The UAE will finance the segment from the new airport of Kukes to the border checkpoint of Morina," Poci said. With a capacity of 100,000 passengers per year, the Kukes airport will belong to the C category of airports. 
 It is expected to provide 150 jobs and spur increased business in the city, including gas stations and other services. 
  OSCE Helps Macedonia's MRTV Move Towards the Multiethnic Age  25/09/2003 Macedonia's only multi-language radio and TV station is getting a makeover, thanks in part to the OSCE.  By Slobodanka Jovanovska for Southeast European Times -- 25/09/03 The only nationwide, multilingual radio and TV station in Macedonia, national broadcaster MRTV, is going through major reforms aimed at boosting its reputation among viewers after years of scarce funding, poor management and lost credibility due to political pressures. About 400 journalists and technicians benefited this summer from a new training centre, supported by the OSCE Spillover Monitoring Mission in Skopje and the Thomson Foundation. The OSCE Mission is co-ordinating international support and assistance to MRTV as it seeks to develop new professional standards and organise an integrated multilingual newsroom. 
 In April, computer-based operations were introduced, providing an opportunity for journalists from various language sections to exchange news material more quickly and easily. The second challenge is to introduce a new team spirit and engage journalists from different ethnicities in preparing news stories, since multiethnic teams generate more balanced journalism. 
 "[The process] will be considered as an important barometer of the willingness and determination of BiH's politicians to adopt and implement EU oriented-reforms," the ambassadors said in a statement. Ambassadors of the Peace Implementation Council steering board said Bosnians on the Indirect Tax Commission, established in February, came up with the draft law, and said parliament should be careful about amending it."This process will be a significant test for the parliamentary parties of BiH," the ambassadors said. 
  Dubrovnik War Crimes Suspect Arrested in Serbia  26/09/2003 The last in a group of officers indicted for their alleged role in the 1991 shelling of Dubrovnik was arrested Thursday in a village southeast of Belgrade. 
 Former Yugoslav Army Captain Vladimir Kovacevic faces six counts of violations of the laws or customs of war.  (Deutsche Welle - 26/09/03; AFP, Reuters, Beta, Radio B92 - 25/09/03; BBC - 22/04/02; ICTY)A former Yugoslav Army officer, indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal for his alleged role in shelling the Croatian city of Dubrovnik in 1991, has been captured by Serbian special police and handed over to the Belgrade district court. Vladimir Kovacevic, also known as Rambo, was arrested in the village of Malo Gradiste, southeast of Belgrade, late Thursday (25 September), the Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement. 
 He was the last of the Dubrovnik indictees still at large. Kovacevic was indicted in 2001 along with three other officers -- Yugoslav Army General Pavle Strugar, Retired Vice Admiral Miodrag Jokic and Navy Vice Admiral Milan Zec -- for the murder of civilians and the destruction caused to the historic city. 
 The prosecutors say he exercised both de jure and de facto power over the forces under his command and have accused him of murder, cruel treatment, attacks on civilians, devastation not justified by military necessity, unlawful attacks on civilian objects, and destruction or wilful damage to institutions dedicated to religion, culture and education, as well as to historic monuments and works of art and science. The indictment alleges that Yugoslav Army forces under the command of Strugar, Jokic and Kovacevic launched an attack against Dubrovnik on 1 October 1991 and in the course of the next three months unlawfully shelled the city and the surrounding areas from land and sea. 
 Batic described his meeting with the chief UN war crimes prosecutor as "exceptionally successful", saying Carla del Ponte had agreed that co-operation had become a two-way process. 
  Hellas Sat A "Decisive Step", Says Greek Prime Minister  29/09/2003 With the inauguration of Hellas Sat, a joint Greek-Cypriot communications satellite, Greece has taken its place among the EU countries with space programmes.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 29/09/03"Greece belongs to the countries that have an active presence in space," Prime Minister Costas Simitis said as he inaugurated the commercial operation of the Greek-Cypriot communications satellite Hellas Sat during a special ceremony this month in the amphitheatre of the transport and communications ministry."Hellas Sat is a decisive step, as Greece will become a member in the international information community, and it will promote telematics in medicine, education and public administration. 
 During the ceremony, Simitis spoke by satellite with Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, the commander of Greek forces in Afghanistan, Major Miltiadis Kollatos, and with Giannis Manousis, mayor of a small Greek island. Hellas Sat is the result of close co-operation between the governments of Greece and Cyprus. 
 Their purpose will be to check the sincerity of the conscientious objector. For example, they will inquire whether the recruit truly belongs to a religious community that prohibits the carrying and use of weapons, or whether he really has an aversion towards weapons. 
  Greece, IOC Dismiss Criticism of 2004 Olympics Security Arrangements  29/09/2003 Security for the Olympics is a top priority and all necessary measures are being taken to ensure safety, officials said in response to a newspaper report alleging serious lapses.  (AFP, ANA - 28/09/03; Washington Post, Reuters - 27/09/08)Officials from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC) have rejected criticism of the security arrangements for the Summer Games. 
 "The reports that I am receiving about the security issue are positive," IOC President Jacques Rogge told Greek media on Sunday (28 September).His statement came a day after the  Washington Post  reported that undercover agents had found serious lapses in security. 
 Citing intelligence reports, the paper said disorganised police forces and breakdowns in maritime patrols were hampering efforts to provide security for the thousands of athletes and spectators expected to arrive in Athens in less than a year. It also pointed to delays in establishing a command and control centre for the Olympics, which would allow police to exchange and have immediate access to information. Greek officials, however, have dismissed the claims. 
 But the country must first meet the political criteria and co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal, he said.  (AFP, HINA, The Guardian, Radio B92 - 29/09/03; Reuters - 25/09/03; HINA - 23/09/03)Western officials have urged Croatia to apprehend key war crimes suspects, saying the country's EU bid hinges on full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)."I call on you to do everything possible to convince Carla del Ponte that you fully co-operate with The Hague tribunal," EU Parliament Speaker Pat Cox said in an address to the Croatian Parliament on Monday (29 September).Del Ponte, the UN's chief war crimes prosecutor, will submit a report to the Security Council in mid-October, assessing the former Yugoslav republics' co-operation with the tribunal. 
  Cash-Strapped Air Bosna Halts Flights  01/10/2003 The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina government is seeking ways to revive its insolvent flagship air carrier.  By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 01/10/03 Air Bosna, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (FBiH) flagship carrier, has terminated all regular commercial flights because its is unable to pay its debts. 
 Options include confirming the election results without upsetting the current balance of power in parliament, redistributing parliamentary seats, or calling new general elections."What is important is to be able to find the most suitable legal solution. 
 A similar fate befell another pro-Kurdish party, HADEP, in March. If the YSK decides to confirm the election results, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) would retain its 363-seat majority. 
 The only other party to meet the 10 per cent threshold last year was the Republican People's Party, which holds 178 parliamentary seats. A decision to cancel DEHAP's votes and redistribute the parliamentary seats would benefit the DYP, which fell just short of meeting the threshold, winning 9.5 per cent of the vote. 
 Redistribution would give the party more than 60 parliamentary seats. The third option, calling new elections, has sparked concerns that Turkey could face instability and that AKP-instituted democratic reforms, adopted in a bid to advance towards EU membership, could be undermined. 
 However, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul on Tuesday downplayed threats to political stability, saying that AKP could gain even more parliamentary seats, should new elections be held. 
  Greek Elections Countdown Is Under Way  02/10/2003 With elections approaching, the leaders of Greece's two largest political parties are doing what they can to attract voter support.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 02/10/03 Greece's ruling PASOK party and the main opposition New Democracy have launched a battle for voter support that will culminate with the next elections. 
 "In certain situations one should choose what serves the interests of one's country over one's career," the minister said Tuesday (30 September).Passy downplayed any possible negative effects on Bulgaria's long-term relations with NATO and the United States. 
 Some considered it a "deliberate offence", he added, given Washington's clearly-stated opposition to Asparuhov when his nomination to head the Bulgarian Intelligence Service was discussed in February."The appointment can affect the image of Bulgaria among alliance members," US Ambassador to Bulgaria James Pardew said in a statement on 26 September. 
 "I am not ready to push the new vote now and destroy this functioning unity."With less than two weeks to go before the start of the talks, Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi had sought the 120-seat assembly's support. 
  Athens Olympics to Generate 6,000 New Jobs  06/10/2003 More than 5,785 people registered as unemployed are going to be hired by the Organising Committee in Athens, starting in November.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 06/10/03 The head of the Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC), Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, has announced that the committee will start hiring in November. 
 Another 150 will be needed to work as translators and interpreters. Most of the positions require a university degree, but some will be open to those without one, Employment Minister Dimitris Reppas said. 
 The positions will be announced through the Athens 2004 Web site. Wages will be paid by ATHOC and will be as high as 780 euros monthly for positions that require a university degree. 
 By comparison, the Olympics in Sydney used 5,300 extras, while the Atlanta Games hired 5,000.Meanwhile, Economy Minister Nikos Christodoulakis said Sunday (5 October) the Athens Olympics would likely boost economic growth in view of the huge investments involved as well as the upsurge in tourism. 
  Turkish Banking Regulator Says Tycoon's Family Embezzled Almost $6 Billion  06/10/2003 Inspectors reported that Kemal Uzan and his family pocketed an amount equivalent to 3 per cent of Turkey's GNP, using a specially designed computer programme to conceal their activities.  (FT - 06/10/03; BBC - 28/08/03; AFP - 26/08/03; Reuters, AFP - 20/08/03; FT, AFP - 26/07/03)Inspectors at Turkey's banking watchdog have reported that business tycoon Kemal Uzan and his family embezzled almost $6 billion in what is being described as the biggest bank fraud in Turkish history, the  Financial Times  reported Monday (6 October). 
 Members of the Uzan family and senior officials at Imar Bank, which the family owns, allegedly used a specially designed computer programme to conceal bank deposits, allowing them to pocket funds equivalent to 3 per cent of Turkey's GNP.Turkey's Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK) has sent the 54-page report -- the result of an inquiry initiated in June -- to prosecutors, along with a request that 22 people allegedly involved in the crime be prosecuted. 
 Hakan Uzan, meanwhile, is also said to have disappeared days before authorities issued an arrest warrant for him and his father. As part of the investigation, authorities have frozen the family's bank accounts and imposed travel bans on the Uzans. 
 Police have conducted several searches of their properties. 
 According to a government statement, "this strategy will reduce the multidimensional costs of chaotic population movement, which had a boom in the first years of the transition due to the new job opportunities, infrastructure, health care, and possibilities for education or professional training."Meanwhile, the government is also addressing the impact of Albanian migration to different countries. 
 A future railway is aimed not only at connecting the airport with the city centre, but also at the transport of goods from the planned cargo centre. 
 The feasibility study now being drafted by the US Agency for Reconstruction and Development has not yet determined where the hotel and cargo centre will be situated, but the airport's surrounding area offers 85 acres for this purpose. 
 Washington stressed, however, that the support was not conditional on the dispatch of Turkish troops to Iraq. A role in the peacekeeping effort would also help Turkey cope with rebels from the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or KADEK, which led a 15-year armed struggle in Turkey that took about 37,000 lives. The United States, which along with Turkey considers KADEK a terrorist organisation, recently assured Ankara that it would help remove the threat posed by the rebels. 
 Gotovina made the offer through his lawyer, Luka Misetic, one day after chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte again urged Gotovina to turn himself in."If, after these talks, Carla del Ponte estimates that she still has proof enough to charge him, he will go to The Hague," the AFP quoted Misetic as telling Croatia's  Vecernji List  daily on Tuesday (7 October).The tribunal indicted Gotovina in May 2001 over his alleged role in the murders of at least 150 ethnic Serb civilians and the expulsion of more than 150,000 others during a military offensive by Croatian forces between 4 August 1995 and 15 November 1995 to retake the Krajina region. 
 He faces five counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of violations of the laws or customs of war for the persecutions, killings, plunder of property, deportation, wanton destruction of cities, towns, or villages, and other inhumane acts he and the forces under his command and control allegedly committed during the operation, dubbed "Storm".Gotovina, who is the tribunal's third most-wanted indictee, went into hiding more than 2 years ago. 
 He voiced Washington's concerns over the Gotovina case and called for more robust efforts to apprehend him."We expect the Croatian government to take steps in searching for General Gotovina," said Prosper. 
  Albania Hosts Important Military Exercises  09/10/2003 US and British troops and the Albanian Army are participating in two important military exercises in Albania, which hopes to eventually join NATO structures.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 09/10/03 For three weeks, Albanian troops were trained to carry out responsibilities in peacekeeping missions and to help the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 What exactly is the rationale behind the Chart, and how will it affect Greeks in the long-term?  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 09/10/03 The Convergence Chart presented by Prime Minister Costas Simitis aims to make big changes in the lives of Greeks, bringing their quality of life closer to EU standards. 
  Top International Officials Seeking Funds for Establishment of War Crimes Chamber in BiH  09/10/2003 The international community's top envoy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Paddy Ashdown, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that the business of bringing war criminals to justice is not yet finished, and that there is a need to develop a local capacity capable of taking over from the UN war crimes tribunal.  (AP, AFP, VOA, UN News Centre, Office of the High Representative, RFE/RL - 08/10/03)Stressing the importance of ensuring justice as part of the peace process, top international officials have appealed for donor funding to help establish a war crimes chamber in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
 The chamber would prosecute lower-level suspects from the 1992-1995 war in BiH, and is seen by the UN Security Council as a key prerequisite for completing the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).Under a completion strategy set forth earlier this year, the ICTY envisages wrapping up its activities in 2010.The international community's top envoy in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, told the Security Council on Wednesday (8 October) that the business of bringing war criminals to justice is not finished yet and that there is a need to develop a local capacity capable of taking over from the tribunal. Its success, however, depends on substantial funding, Ashdown said. 
 But Alliance officials stress no decisions have been made.  (FT - 10/10/03; AP, AFP, Reuters, Canadian Press, Washington File, NATO - 09/10/03)Eight years after launching its peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), NATO has indicated that the operation might be turned over to the EU by the end of 2004, as its goals have basically been achieved. 
 Ethnic Albanian politicians are reluctant to be seen as co-operating with Belgrade or stepping back from demands for independence."If the dialogue is to succeed, they [Serbian and Kosovo politicians] must be made to understand that Brussels and Washington expect them not only to talk but also to produce results," writes Daniel Serwer, of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting. 
 His parents, David and Ozlem Grimason, together with the UMUT Foundation, have collected 150,000 signatures both in Turkey and overseas, hoping to persuade the government to take the issue of gun crime more seriously."Our lives are ruined. 
  Progress Between Greece and Turkey for the Cyprus Problem  14/10/2003 Both Turkey and Greece have agreed on the basis for resolving the Cyprus dispute, and a solution is expected by December 2004.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 14/10/03 In 15 months the Cyprus problem will have been solved, according to a wide range of international officials. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, US Secretary of State Colin Powell, US State Department Special Co-ordinator for Cyprus Thomas Weston, and UN Special Envoy to Cyprus Alvaro de Soto have all agreed on UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan as a basis for resolving the decades-old issue. The first important milestone will occur on 14 December. 
  EU Ministers Press Western Balkan Countries to Fully Co-operate with ICTY  14/10/2003 Failure to improve co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal could jeopardise the EU bids of Western Balkan countries, ministers from the 15 EU member states warned on Monday.  (EU, AP, AFP, HINA, Radio Netherlands, Radio B92 - 13/10/03; ICTY - 10/10/03)EU foreign ministers have called on Balkan countries to improve their co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), stressing that failure to do so could put their EU bids at risk. Following a presentation by ICTY chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte at a European Council meeting in Luxembourg on Monday (13 October), the foreign ministers of the 15 member states acknowledged that while some progress had been made, there was reason for "deep concern" over the lack of full co-operation by "a number of countries and parties" in the region. The ministers called for stronger efforts to bring to justice the UN tribunal's top three indictees -- wartime Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, and retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina. 
 Following the deadline, Washington suspended $47m in military aid to 35 countries, under a law banning such aid to countries that did not sign immunity agreements. Simonovic said that the military aid -- which in Croatia's case amounts to about $5m annually -- is not the issue."It's far more important in some symbolic sense," he said. 
  SFOR Troops, ICTY Investigators Conduct Searches  16/10/2003 Days after chief UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Bosnian Serbs and Croats for failure to co-operate with The Hague tribunal, SFOR troops and UN war crimes investigators raided offices in Republika Srpska, looking for documents.  (Reuters, AP, AFP, RFE/RL - 15/10/03; AFP - 14/10/03)SFOR troops backed UN war crimes investigators as they searched intelligence service offices across Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska (RS), on Wednesday (15 October), looking for documents wanted by the UN tribunal in The Hague."Following an order from the tribunal, investigators, with the assistance of SFOR, are searching a number of locations in Republika Srpska looking for documents that the authorities have consistently failed to provide," SFOR spokesman Captain Dave Sullivan said Wednesday. The raids came only days after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) criticised Bosnian Serbs and Croats for their failure to co-operate with the tribunal. 
 The RS authorities have not located and arrested even a single indicted fugitive so far, Carla del Ponte told the UN Security Council last week. 
 Five boxes with documents reportedly were seized from an office there. Several boxes of documents and a computer were seized during a similar operation on Tuesday, when US and Italian peacekeepers raided the interior ministry and intelligence service of the Muslim-Croat entity in BiH.In her recent statement before the Security Council, del Ponte also criticised Bosnian Croat authorities in the federation for having provided "very little co-operation" in cases involving Bosnian Croat perpetrators. 
  Restoration Deadline Looms for Ancient Monuments in Greece  17/10/2003 Greece's Culture Ministry has acknowledged not all the planned restoration projects will be completed before millions of visitors arrive for next year's Summer Olympics.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 17/10/03 With only 10 months before visitors start arriving in Athens for the Olympic Games, it is doubtful that all the planned cultural projects will be ready. 
 The city's most famous landmark, the Parthenon, is covered by scaffolding on its north side. 
 The adjoining National Archaeological Museum probably will not have most of its exhibit rooms ready. In Thessaloniki, the second Olympic city, only one third of the archaeological museum will be ready on time; and in Heraklio in Crete, the museum will not be built at all, because artefacts were found on site. The ancient site of Olympia is going to be ready, even though there was more work on the eroded east wing than originally planned. 
 Instead of re-erecting the Gate of Adrianos, located in the centre of Athens, restorers are merely cleaning it and making sure it is stable. The good news is that most of the minor museums will be ready on time. 
 The projects for the Byzantine Museums of Athens -- housed in the Duchess of Plakentia Mansion -- and Thessaloniki are ahead of schedule. 
 About 50 countries in the world have signed similar bilateral agreements with Washington, including three other Balkan states -- Romania, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).Following debate, 78 of the 80 MPs attending the session of Macedonia's 120-seat assembly on Thursday (16 October) voted in favour of the law on the ratification of the accord. 
  Tension Mounts Between University Rectors and Turkish Government  20/10/2003 While there is consensus that changes are needed, the draft law concerning Turkey's Higher Education Board has drawn criticism.  By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 20/10/03 University rectors are at odds with the government regarding a new Higher Education Board (YOK) draft law which will be sent to the parliament this month. 
 University professors, rather than the board, would select their candidates. 
 The new board would consist of 17 members from the inter-university committee, as well as top officials from the finance, education, health and labour ministries, the General Staff and State Planning Organisation, the Turkish Union for Chamber and Commodities' Exchanges and the Turkish Employers' Union. 
 Members would serve for three years. Although the YOK has come under fire from students, faculty members and university administrators, the government's planned overhaul has raised objections as well. 
 Among its election promises was that it would give female students the right to wear headscarves at universities and schools. 
 The current dress code prohibits them from doing so, but the new law could mean changes to that code. Some rectors have also warned that lifting the YOK's authority in the selection of university rectors would create anarchy in the universities, while others complain that the new law would give Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan an opportunity to select the rectors of nearly 30 universities. 
 Rectors also say the proposed law was not discussed by universities, faculties and Inter-universities committee prior to its drafting. Responding to these charges, Erdogan pledged that a joint study will be undertaken together with the inter-university committee and the education ministry. 
  ICTY Says New Croatian Parliament Decision Illegal  20/10/2003 Prime Minister Ivica Racan expressed regret over a parliamentary decision obliging the government to provide war crimes suspects and indictees with access to legal documents even if they have not appeared at The Hague, but said the government would implement the measure.  (AFP, HINA - 19/10/03; Reuters, HINA, AFP - 17/10/03)Officials of the UN war crimes tribunal have cautioned Croatia against implementing a controversial decision, adopted by parliament on Friday (17 October), which obliges the government to provide all war crimes suspects and indictees with access to legal documents."The Croatian government has very good legal advisers and knows very well that the decision of the Sabor [the Croatian Parliament] is illegal, and the office of the prosecutor cannot be satisfied with it," the Zagreb-based  Vecernji List  daily quoted Florance Hartmann, spokeswoman for UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, as saying."The office of the prosecutor will certainly respond if the Croatian government delivers documents to persons who have no legitimacy of representation before The Hague tribunal," Hartmann added. Questioning the measure's legality, Deputy Prime Minister Goran Granic resigned as head of the government's body on co-operation with The Hague."It would be illegal and against the rules of The Hague tribunal to provide documents, already delivered for ongoing court procedures, to individuals who are not part of those procedures," Granic, who is retaining the post of deputy prime minister, wrote in his letter of resignation. 
 Such a convention would "provide a common legal platform to prevent, investigate and prosecute terrorist offenders more efficiently," Schwimmer said."Our message remains that the fight against terrorism must be carried out without concessions, but always respecting the values the Council of Europe stands for," he added. Schwimmer's words were echoed by the European justice ministers, who emphasised the need for enhanced international co-operation. 
 Standardisation of the accommodation capacity and the means of communication, as well as the equipment and weapons of the special task forces of the army and interior ministry, will take place in order to avoid redundancy and to establish joint wage standards. The formation process will occur in phases, and is expected to cost 20m euros. 
 Its unsealing angered Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic, who criticised the tribunal's move as ill-timed and "a blow to reform in Serbia"."Why today -- seven days after the meeting in Vienna with the Kosovo Albanians and the international community, during a campaign for presidential elections in Serbia and when we are just about to start a debate on confidence in the government," Zivkovic said. Pavkovic, Lazarevic and Lukic are all said to be in Belgrade. 
 Djordjevic's whereabouts are unknown following his disappearance last year, Belgrade-based Radio B92 reported. Speaking from London, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte confirmed reports in the Serbian media that she had delivered the indictment during her visit to Belgrade on 6 October, but Zivkovic refused to accept it. 
 Both Ankara and Washington consider the separatist PKK/KADEK, which is based mainly in camps in northern Iraq, a terrorist organisation. 
 "Under difficult circumstances in the Balkans, he played an important role in ending the war in his country."Doctors at Sarajevo University's Clinical Centre said Izetbegovic's death was caused by a long period of heart problems, complicated by injuries he suffered recently during a fall at his home. Police officials said they were expecting around 150,000 Bosnians and foreign officials, including Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, to attend the funeral in the BiH capital. 
  Serbia's Zivkovic Says Police Searching for Mladic  23/10/2003 Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic announced Wednesday that Serbian police have launched an operation aimed at nabbing top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic. 
 Zivkovic described it as a routine action.  (Reuters, AFP, Radio B92 - 22/10/03)Acting on an anonymous tip, police in Serbia have launched a search for top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said Wednesday (22 October), stressing it was a routine action."This is nothing new, we react to every tip-off that sounds serious," he was quoted as saying on Serbian television. Without offering details about either the new or previous operations, Zivkovic vowed that actions to locate Mladic would continue. 
 "If not every day, we will do it at least three times a week."A police source has suggested that more details would become available Thursday. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Carla del Ponte, has been insisting for months that Mladic is hiding in Serbia. 
 Along with former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina, Mladic is one of the UN tribunal's top three indictees. Zivkovic's announcement came only two days after the ICTY unsealed a new indictment against four Serbian generals, accusing them of participation in "a campaign of terror and violence against Kosovo Albanians" in 1999. 
 On 29 September, the Athens News Agency reported that seven people, believed to be Iranian refugees, died on the Turkish-Greek border, due to landmines. 
  Gotovina's Surrender Crucial to Croatia's Integration into the EU  24/10/2003 Indicted by the ICTY in 2001 for alleged war crimes, General Ante Gotovina remains at large, and pressure is mounting in Zagreb to capture and turn him over to the UN tribunal.  By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 24/10/03 Croatian officials are trying to minimise possible consequences of the recent report by UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who told the Security Council that Croatia is not fully co-operating with The Hague. 
 "We are talking about real problems in agriculture, healthcare and the economy, and we are talking about poverty. 
 Research shows that Turkey has a large potential in underground and natural sources, but limited utilisation."Our priority is to utilise domestic sources as much as possible," Energy and Natural Resources Minister Hilmi Guler told participants at the congress. 
 It will supply heat and electricity to approximately 40,000 homes and approximately 50 acres of greenhouses. 
 When the second plant is finished in 2009, it is expected to supply heat and electricity to 100,000 homes. Current reports indicate that Turkey has the 7th largest geothermal capacity in the world -- 35 per cent of all residential areas in the country are available for geothermal heating and there are 140 geothermal areas countrywide. 
 Similarly, Turkey used only 0.8, 0.03 and 30 per cent, respectively, of its solar, wind and hydro capacity in 2001. 
  Women Still Victims of Trafficking in the Balkans  28/10/2003 Despite government measures, human trafficking continues to be a serious problem in Balkan countries.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 28/10/03 Human trafficking and prostitution remain among the most difficult problems facing Southeastern Europe. 
 Greek traffickers visit the city and "buy" women for less than 2,000 euros, recalling the transatlantic slavery of previous centuries. According to human rights associations, Bulgaria has not managed to reduce its role either as a source or transit country for human trafficking. 
  New Cuts on the Way for Greek Taxpayers  28/10/2003 Greece's business community has welcomed government plans to overhaul the tax system.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 28/10/03 Two months ago, the government of Prime Minister Costas Simitis pledged to cut taxes, a move the opposition dismissed as making empty election promises. 
 Under the Simitis plan, however, inspectors would have to report any breaches of the Code of Bookkeeping and, depending on severity, the offending business would be penalised according to a point system. The new system would reduce the taxman's authority and give the central government more control over violations, allowing it to maintain more complete records. The business community has welcomed the proposed overhaul. Spokespersons of the Chambers of Commerce from Athens, the Confederation of Greek Industries and other organisations related to local business communities have described the changes as a great step forward, arguing that they will help attract foreign investments. 
 In a signed personal declaration attached to his plea agreement, he also confessed to attending a meeting on 12 July 1995 to discuss "the operation to transport the women and children to Kladanj and separate, detain and kill the able-bodied Muslim men in Potocari". 
 He also said that upon orders from his superiors, he had "co-ordinated the effort to exhume and rebury Muslims from mid-September to October 1995".In September, Nikolic became the highest-ranking Bosnian Serb officer with inside information to testify in connection with the massacre. Speaking under oath at the trial of Colonel Vidoje Blagojevic, commander of the Bratunac brigade, and Lieutenant Colonel Dragan Jokic, Nikolic gave a firsthand account of the events surrounding the massacre, detailing also the Bosnian Serb chain of command. Mladic and Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic -- the UN tribunal's most wanted indictees still at large -- have been accused of genocide for their role in the incident, the single worst atrocity in Europe since World War II. 
 "I believe the new volunteers have the determination and skills to make a real impact during this time of historic change in Albania."The US Peace Corps serves in 69 countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Europe, and the Middle East. 
 However, the commission could be seen as a stalling tactic, as the government was also required by the court to reveal the location of mass graves of those who went missing after the fall of Srebrenica. Court President Michele Picard noted in a letter to Ashdown on 14 October that the RS government hasn't contacted any families about the fate or whereabouts of missing relatives. Such a commission may be redundant for those who follow the UN war crimes tribunal, the news, or the dozens of reports that have come out since the massacre. 
 "If it ends up being a legitimate, objective commission, it could help the people in the RS see what everyone else sees."Ashdown said that to keep obstruction to a minimum, both he and ICTY chief war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte would each suggest a commission member. The 7 March court ruling resulted from a case brought by 49 Srebrenica survivors, and also decreed that the RS government had to pay 2m euros to the Srebrenica-Potocari Foundation. 
 It also helped to organise seminars for banks, bank controllers, police, judges and prosecutors. Washington also has provided computer equipment, expert and technical support -- through USAID, US Treasury consultants, IBM and Bearingpoint -- to aid the Serbia-Montenegrin police. Joint efforts by Washington and the Council of Europe will enable Serbia-Montenegro to strengthen its legal framework and control mechanisms for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. 
 Also, the United States and the EU wish to ensure the security and stability of the banking system and provide all necessary means for the prevention, timely revelation, and criminal prosecution of all sorts of criminal activities. At the same time, the OSCE mission in Serbia-Montenegro and the German embassy in Belgrade have given computer equipment to the Serbian police that will help in the fight against organised crime. 
  New Urban Plan for Belgrade  03/11/2003 To accommodate Belgrade's projected expansion in the coming decades, the city has developed an urban plan that will consider such factors as population growth and new construction.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 03/11/03 Belgrade has adopted a new urban plan designed to foster expansion in the coming decades. 
 The goals are to promote sustainable development and transform the Serbian capital into a European metropolis, according to officials presenting the plan to the municipal legislature."Suffering many blows over the years, the city has reached a low point in terms of daily functioning which in many areas borders on virtual collapse," said Vice President of Muncipal Government Ljubomir Andjelkovic. 
 The previous general plan, adopted in 1972, has been "overstepped by time and living conditions", he noted. The new general plan will guide city development until the year 2021. 
 According to Ferencak, an outer city zone has been introduced next to the central and suburban zones, facilitating better planning. 
 The president of the municipal government, Nenad Bogdanovic, said the plan is not perfect, but will provide a good basis for fast development of the city. 
 The new general plan will permit us to conduct urban regulation of 95 percent of the city which has been attacked by illegal construction," he said. The objective is to establish a European Belgrade, while also maintaining the city's Serbian character, and to create a climate that will attract investors to help realise this strategy and make a better life possible for its citizens, Bogdanovic added. The plan is two and a half years in the making, while public discussion has lasted two months. 
 Another ten will be governed by BSP mayors, while the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), won in the town of Kurdjali, dominated by ethnic Turks, in the first round on 26 October. 
 Independent candidates won the mayoral seats in the remaining five district centres. The turnout on Sunday was just over 50 per cent, according to the Central Electoral Commission. The BSP will have the largest representation in the country after winning 1,942 of all 5,200 municipal council seats. 
 All of these parties fielded candidates in the first attempt, in September 2002, an election invalidated by low turnout. While the government uses this election to continue fighting for reforms, the opposition announced that victory in the presidential elections would prompt them to try to force early parliamentary elections. Calling the presidential election is a brave move by the current government, a move that carries a certain amount of risk. 
  UN Backs Greek Olympic Truce Resolution  04/11/2003 A resolution calling for warring parties to observe a traditional truce during the 2004 Olympic Games has passed the UN General Assembly.  (UN News Centre, AP - 03/11/03; International Olympic Committee - 31/10/03; BBC - 27/09/03; AFP, UN News Centre - 26/09/03; Athens 2004 Organising Committee)The UN General Assembly backed a resolution Monday (3 November) calling on warring parties around the world to observe a traditional truce during the Summer Olympics in Athens, from 13 August to 29 August 2004."If we could have peace for 16 days, maybe, just maybe, we can have it forever," Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said, addressing the 58th session of the UN General Assembly on 26 September, when he submitted the truce proposal on behalf of his country."The call to observe the Olympic truce is an appeal for the Games to silence the guns -- all over the world," said UN Secretary General Kofi Annan last month. Speaking after Monday's vote, Annan said the resolution, entitled "Building a Peaceful and Better World through Sport and the Olympic Ideal", was sending a powerful message of hope to the international community."I hope that people in all conflict areas -- from Iraq to Afghanistan to Liberia to the Congo -- will really listen to the message. 
 The populations should also work to make demands for peace, and that the fighting must stop."More than 100 heads of state and government, parliament speakers and foreign ministers have signed a Greek-sponsored statement in support of the Olympic truce, pledging "to exercise our best efforts to ensure that the Olympic truce appeal is observed in our countries and in our region during the upcoming Olympic Games".Welcoming passage of the resolution, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge said the truce would give "the youth of the world the chance to show how we all can peacefully coexist, just as they do in the Olympic Village".The idea of the Olympic truce, or ekechereia, dates back to the ancient Greek tradition of observing peace during the Games, which was respected for 12 centuries. 
 In the antiquity, the truce lasted from the 7th day before the start of the Games to the 7th day after their close. That tradition was revived in 1992 at the initiative of the IOC, which appealed for observance of an Olympic truce during the 1994 winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, so that athletes from the former Yugoslav republics could participate. Since the first resolution in 1993, the adoption of an Olympic truce resolution has become customary for the UN General Assembly, occurring every two years, several months before the opening of the Games. In other news, FBI Director Robert Mueller is due to visit Athens on Thursday to inspect the security arrangements for the Games. 
 A new, more flexible and "cheap" structure is being negotiated.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 05/11/03 The Defence Committee, chaired by Defence Minister Yannos Papantoniou, made its final decisions late last month concerning the structure and form of command of the Greek Armed Forces. 
  Del Ponte Says the Tribunal Will Press Charges in Macedonian Case  06/11/2003 The chief prosecutor of The Hague tribunal says the tribunal will bring criminal charges in one case stemming from the 2001 conflict in Macedonia by the end of the year.  By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 06/11/03 The chief prosecutor of The Hague tribunal, Carla del Ponte, said it was possible that charges in one of two cases of alleged war crimes committed during the 2001 conflict would be brought by year's end. 
 Blewitt announced that the investigations would be completed in 12 months and specified that they were focusing on leading figures in both the National Liberation Army (ONA) and Macedonian security forces. Nearly a year ago this month, Macedonian courts handed five cases -- relating to police action at the village of Ljuboten, leaders of ONA, a dam closing, torturing workers, and an alleged mass grave -- to the tribunal. 
 According to allegations by local residents, Macedonian security forces killed ten civilians in the village of Ljuboten.. 
 The alleged mass grave at the village of Neprosteno was thought to have been related to the kidnapping of 12 ethnic Macedonians in the Tetovo area who have not yet been found. Under the tribunal statute, it is the Council of Judges that makes the final decision on pressing charges. 
 More than 640,000 girls are not allowed to go to school in Turkey, due to traditional, economic or religious reasons. Edmund McLoughney, Turkey's UNICEF representative, visited small villages in eastern Turkey to introduce the campaign. 
 Some NGOs have said that 77 million government-donated schoolbooks have conservative and Islamic content. The government's proposal to enroll 10,000 students chosen from poor families in private schools, where the ministry of education would cover all expenses, was also rejected. 
  US Restores Normal Trade Relations with Serbia-Montenegro  10/11/2003 After ten years of trade sanctions, Washington has restored Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to Serbia-Montenegro.  By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 10/11/03 After more than a decade, normal trade relations between the United States and Serbia-Montenegro will resume on 1 December, under a decree signed by US Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
 As a result, by the end of 2004, Croatia will extend its jurisdiction in the sea, particularly with regard to fishing zones. 
 The move prompted strong criticism from neighbouring Slovenia and Italy, as well as from the EU.Croatian politicians have justified the move by citing the need to protect the resources of the Adriatic, where a lack of fish is becoming a problem and the country is facing a constant influx of foreign ships, searching for areas that have not been depleted. 
 All the countries of the Mediterranean region have been invited to the forum to share ideas on how to protect the sea resources. 
 The move was agreed on during a telephone conversation between Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and US Secretary of State Colin Powell late Thursday, reports said. The Turkish government's earlier decision to contribute troops to the US-led peacekeeping forces in Iraq was approved by parliament in early October, but met with fierce opposition from the Iraqi Governing Council and Iraqi Kurds. Turkish public opinion was also against the plan to send troops."We said from the beginning that we were not too eager anyway," the BBC quoted Gul as saying on Friday. 
 That's why we made this decision."State Department spokesman Richard Boucher voiced Washington's regret Friday over the change of plans, but said the bottom line was to ensure stability in Iraq. 
 According to her, 1.2 billion DM were deposited into the Yugoslav Fund for Development through the Bank of Belgrade, and the government used the money to pay pensions and subsidise health care and other social services. 
  Greek Tourism Industry Revises 2010 Targets  11/11/2003 An estimated 150,000 new positions will be created in the next seven years as a result of the government's new targets for Greek tourism.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 11/11/03 The Ministry of Development is making a continuous effort to strengthen the single most popular product in Greece: tourism. 
 Picturesque villages and areas around Greece have used funding to convert old mansions and small castles and forts into guest houses, catering to tourists who want quieter holidays. At the same time, an effort is being made to enhance cultural tourism, for those interested in discovering the sites of Ancient Greece. 
 During a trilateral meeting of defence ministers, Greece also voiced support for Albania's and Macedonia's accession to Euro-Atlantic structures.  (AFP, Macedonian Press Agency, Athens News Agency, MIA, Makfax - 10/11/03)The defence ministers of Albania, Greece and Macedonia pledged Monday (10 November) to step up military co-operation to address common threats more efficiently, including those posed by illegal immigration and cross-border organised crime. 
 Greek Defence Minister Yannos Papantoniou also assured his counterparts of his country's support for their EU and NATO bids."We have to promote and encourage co-operation between the three countries' military commands ... to more efficiently confront common threats and dangers," Papantoniou said in the northwestern Greek city of Kastoria, following talks with his Albanian and Macedonian counterparts, Pandeli Majko and Vlado Buckovski. During their meeting, the ministers discussed a wide range of measures for achieving this goal, including participation in joint military exercises and in other initiatives, such as cultural and sporting events. 
 They promised to provide Greece with intelligence information concerning any potential threats against the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The ministers also approved a Macedonian initiative in support of Serbia-Montenegro's accession to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and the SEE peacekeeping brigade (SEEBRIG), to be presented at the SEE defence ministers' meeting in Zagreb next month. On Monday, Greece and Albania signed a co-operation agreement on military training in joint exercises, as well as on other forms of Greek assistance meant to aid the swift adjustment of Albania's armed forces to European and NATO structures. 
 On that date, only the police and army members will be permitted to carry weapons in public places."Dehari said the gun he had handed in was a gift from a Kosovo friend. 
 There were problems with the opening of collection points in the municipalities of Aracinovo, Lipkovo and Studenicani, where the mayors -- from the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) -- refused to take part. 
 The OSCE and the EU have appealed to the DPA to co-operate in the campaign."It is widely known that all mayors were invited to take part in the municipal disarmament commissions. 
  Greece Expands Counter Terrorism Measures for 2004 Olympics  13/11/2003 Greece is planning to form a special unit to handle potential nuclear, chemical or biological threats during the 2004 Olympics in Athens, as officials say the country can cope with the security aspects of the Games.  (AP, AFP, Kathimerini, Macedonian Press Agency - 12/11/03; BBC - 07/11/03)The Greek Defence Ministry said Wednesday (12 November) that it would set up a 200-member special unit to address nuclear, chemical and biological threats during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. 
 The decision is part of the government's plans to step up anti-terrorism measures for the Games."We are ready to face any threat as a military, especially during the Olympic Games," Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said, denying media reports that other countries would be sending troops and equipment to bolster security next August. The Athens Olympics will be the first summer Games since the terror attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. 
 In September, the  Washington Post  reported that police forces were disorganised and that there had been breakdowns in maritime patrols. According to the paper, an agent disguised as a pregnant woman had managed to pass through a checkpoint with a mock bomb. 
 And we have every confidence they will," the BBC quoted a US State Department official as saying last week, when FBI Director Robert Mueller visited Athens to review the security arrangements at Olympic sites and venues. During meetings with Greek officials, Mueller said they should consider all possible terrorist scenarios. Word of the new counterterrorist unit follows a series of small bomb attacks in Athens. 
 Last week, small explosions damaged three other banks in downtown Athens. Greek Public Order Minister Georges Floridis said Wednesday that the attacks didn't "have the same nature as terrorism suffered by the country over past years", but could harm Greece's image ahead of the Games if investigations prove they were of a "serious" nature. 
 Lawmakers from the opposition VMRO-DPMNE voted against the move. Macedonian Social Democratic Union member and Parliament Speaker Nikola Popovski took the helm at the finance ministry; Democratic Union of Integration member and outgoing parliamentary Vice Chairman Agron Buxaku will head the transport and communication ministry; Karpos Municipality Mayor Stefco Jakimovski, of the Liberal Democratic Party, became minister of economy; and Ixet Memeti, a judge in the Macedonian Constitutional Court, returned to the post of justice minister, which he previously held in a coalition government formed during the 2001 crisis. In statements following the vote, the new ministers announced their priorities. 
 But the director of the Kozloduy plant, Yordan Kostadinov, says that their capacity depends on the continued operation of units 3 and 4.The plant accounts for about 45 per cent of Bulgaria's electricity output. 
  Turkish-Greek Relations Warming  17/11/2003 Despite scant progress in resolving the disputes in Cyprus and the Aegean Sea, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul's latest visit to Athens contributed to peace efforts between the two countries.  By Vahit Bora for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 17/11/03 On his first visit to Athens as foreign minister, Turkey's Abdullah Gul held talks with his Greek counterpart, George Papandreou. 
 Addressing a joint press conference last month, Gul said Athens and Ankara are determined to settle their differences peacefully and with mutual understanding."The long-standing tensions with neighbouring Greece are a thing of the past and our relations are now governed by a climate of friendship and trust," he said. 
 Among the issues discussed by Gul and Papandreou were Cyprus, disputed boundaries in the Aegean Sea, Turkey's EU membership bid and bilateral relations. Regarding Cyprus, Papandreou said there was now a historic opportunity to unite the island as it prepares to join the EU next year, adding that Turkey could play a determining role. 
 "The political leadership of Kosovo has got to stand firmly in favour of a multiethnic Kosovo," Robertson told residents of Novo Selo, an ethnically mixed village about 29km north of Pristina. It was Robertson's last visit to Kosovo as NATO chief. 
 "We want them to come back and this shows the international community is delivering on that."Several Serb families have returned to the village after UNMIK and local institutions stepped up efforts to improve the refugee return process. About 200,000 Kosovo Serbs fled the province after the end of the 1998-1999 conflict, fearing revenge attacks. 
 He laid wreaths at the sites as Turks placed white carnations as a sign of condolence."We have complete trust in the Turkish government in the investigations. 
  Athens Confident About Olympics "Total Security Dogma"  19/11/2003 US lawmakers have voiced confidence that Greece will adopt all necessary measures to ensure the security of the 2004 Olympic Games. 
 The country plans to spend over 650m euros on Olympic security, and that figure could rise.  By Athanassios Papandropoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 19/11/03 Four senior US lawmakers sent a letter to Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis on Tuesday (18 November) to express their confidence that Athens would stage a successful Olympics Games in 2004. 
 US Ambassador to Greece Thomas Miller has argued that comparisons between the Athens Games and other Olympics are unfair. 
 Security would have proved challenging regardless of the host city, he added. Athens organisers acknowledge the value of foreign assistance on security issues. 
 Otherwise, the ruling majority would have to reach consensus on redefining the presidential election in the new constitution, and the head of state would be elected in parliament. Many analysts think that DOS made a mistake in calling elections for the holiday season, as its supporters are mainly young, educated, and affluent people, many of whom will be away on holiday. 
 All the major parties -- the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), the G17 Plus, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), Milosevic's Socialists, and the Serbian Renewal Movement -- have announced they will throw the hat in the ring on their own. Local media is speculating that the SDP will be rewarded for denying its support to the government with several MP seats in the G17 Plus election list. 
 According to recent surveys, HDZ leads with 20 per cent to 28 per cent support, 2 per cent to 9 per cent more than SDP.Analysts say that the centre-left coalition needs high voter turnout in the election and the ongoing support of its main coalition partner, the Croatian Peasants' Party, which is keeping its cards close to its chest. 
  FBI Weighs in on Balkan Organised Crime  21/11/2003 An FBI statement before a US Senate Committee in October assessed the organised crime situation in the Balkans.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 21/11/03 Organised crime in the Balkans has attracted the interest of the American law enforcement community and the US Senate. 
 The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) believes that crime from the Balkans, Eastern and Central Europe, and the former Soviet Union is expanding and will continue to expand."In the last year or two, European nations have recognised that Balkan organised crime is one of the greatest criminal threats that they face," Assistant Director of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division Grant D. Ashley said in an October statement before the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. He added that European police organisations estimate that Balkan crime rings now control more than 70 per cent of the heroin market in some of the larger European nations, and are rapidly taking over human smuggling, prostitution and car theft rings across Europe. Analysts believe the gangs are involved in all kinds of criminal activity -- drug trafficking, human trafficking, burglary and home invasion robbery, money laundering and securities fraud, organised crime gambling and extortion rackets. According to Ashley, organised crime groups from Albania have expanded their activitites in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain, and the Scandinavian countries. 
 Two suicide bombings against British targets in Turkey's largest city on Thursday (20 November) left at least 27 dead and more than 450 wounded. 
 The attacks came only five days after explosions at two synagogues killed another 25 people and injured hundreds of others."We all woke up to shocking news and I condemn totally the latest terrorist attacks in Istanbul .Those who carried out these attacks have no respect for human life and we should condemn utterly their actions," UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a statement on Thursday, expressing his "deepest condolence to the governments and peoples of Turkey and the United Kingdom, and especially to the families of the victims."Four British citizens were among the 27 killed in the suicide bombings of London-based HSBC bank and the British consulate. 
 Roger Short, the British consul general in Istanbul, was among the dead. Short was considered an expert on the Balkans, having spent most of his career in the region. 
 In a resolution passed unanimously on Thursday, the Council urged all states "to co-operate in efforts to find and bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks", voicing its reinforced determination to fight all forms of terrorism. In separate statements issued hours after the attacks, NATO and the EU also expressed their commitment to co-operation in the global campaign against terror, with the Alliance stressing its "determination to use all the means at its disposal" to bring the people behind "these inhuman acts" to justice."The terrorists who carry out such barbarities will receive the contempt of all civilised people," NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson said. 
 Around 48 per cent of the victims were between the ages of 18 and 24.The representative of the Council for the Prevention of Family Violence, Vesna Stanojevic, said that starting last year shelters have been set up in Serbia-Montnegro to care for victims. 
 Incumbent Prime Minister Ivica Racan, meanwhile, has acknowledged that his Social Democratic party (SDP) and its allies did not win enough votes to form a cabinet. With more than 96 per cent of the vote counted, the HDZ and its two coalition partners are expected to get 72 seats in the 140-seat parliament. 
 The ruling Social Democrats and their allies will have 65 seats. 
 The recently established Pensioner's Party turned out to be one of the biggest surprises, gaining enough votes for three seats in parliament. 
 Minority parties will have eight seats. Croatians living abroad, who are traditionally supportive of the HDZ, could get as many as 12 mandates but the actual number depends on their turnout. After all the votes have been counted, the electoral commission will verify the winner and President Stipe Mesic will nominate a new prime minister. 
 He has had a telephone conversation with Mesic, but no official meeting has been scheduled. HDZ has promised to fulfil the country's strategic goals of joining NATO in 2006 and the EU in 2007. 
 "Somebody will soon arrive with instructions what to do with the prisoners," Deronjic said Karadzic had told him. The same night, Deronjic testified, Bosnian Serb Army Chief of Security Ljubisa Beara, who reported to Ratko Mladic, came to Bratunac with "orders. from the top that all prisoners should be executed".Karadzic and Mladic, who top the UN war crimes tribunal's list of most wanted suspects, have been charged with genocide over the Srebrenica massacre, the worst atrocity in European history since the end of World War II.Deronjic, himself indicted for alleged war crimes during the 1992-1995 war in BiH, was arrested by SFOR troops in July 2002. 
 Meanwhile, the elections approach.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25/11/03 In a letter to Prime Minister Costas Simitis, Bank of Greece Governor Nicholas Garganas has voiced concerns about Olympic spending, the ballooning deficit and promises of new benefits, warning that the next government of Greece will have huge burden on its shoulders. According to Garganas, the deficit won't allow reduction of the public debt and will not slow the rate of inflation, which is undermining competitiveness. 
 Although it may not mean much to the average citizen, the rising deficits signal that Greece has taken a step backwards in fiscal management. The government's fiscal worries, combined with fears of a public reproach from the EU, is the major reason for Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis' refusal to accommodate strikers demanding higher raises, including school teachers, university professors, policemen and nurses. 
 Both he and Ugurlu had previously been named as accomplices of Mesut Cabuk and Gokhan Elaltuntas, the alleged suicide bombers in the 15 November attack on two Istanbul synagogues. According to reports, at least three of the bombers were from the southeastern city of Bingol, considered a breeding ground of the Hezbollah radical Islamic group, which is unrelated to the Lebanese group of the same name. A local official has said that the authorities are examining the hard drives of 10 computers seized from an Internet cafe in Bingol following the synagogue explosions. 
 According to the British newspaper  Independent , the cafe was co-owned by Elaltuntas's father and Ekinci's brother. British press reports say Scotland Yard experts are helping Turkish police in their investigations. Several Turkish and foreign officials have described the recent attacks in Istanbul as resembling in pattern those launched by Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda terror network. Al-Qaeda and a small Turkish group called the Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front have claimed responsibility for Thursday's bombings. 
  Olympic Catering: 400,000 Meals a Day  26/11/2003 More than 17,000 people will be working in the largest kitchen in the world to produce 400,000 meals daily based on 2,000 different recipes during the Athens Summer Olympics.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 26/11/03 Greece is the smallest country to host the Olympic Games, but it is bound to become the country with the single biggest kitchen in Europe. 
 It will be the equivalent of setting up the largest restaurant chain in Europe for 17 days. That presents a golden opportunity for food producers and suppliers in the region, as well as for related sectors such as warehouses and logistics companies. The 12 million meals will be served in the sports centres, stadiums, office, press centres and the Olympic Village. 
 Every truck will be checked before departure and at delivery, to minimise the chances of food contamination or poisoning. To protect the Games and the interests of the sponsors, no visitors will be allowed to enter an Olympic site if they are carrying food or drink from outside. 
 Some sources have mentioned that the Olympics are a good opportunity for terrorists to strike, so a sizeable piece of the budget is going towards making sure that nothing suspicious disguised as food can enter the sites, and that no-one can tamper with the food. According ATHOC officials, the main restaurant at the Olympic Village will have the capacity to prepare 6,000 meals per hour. 
 However, the party will "co-operate with the future government, as we did with the previous one, on issues important for the Serb community and the democratisation of Croatia", he said. According to official election results released Tuesday, HDZ won 33.16 per cent of the vote and will hold 66 seats in the 152-seat parliament. 
 Its potential allies, the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), the Social-Liberal Party, and the Democratic Centre, won eight, two, and one seat respectively. 
 The Social Democrats took 34 seats with 23.31 per cent of the vote. 
 Its four current coalition partners won a total of 24 seats. 
 Ethnic minorities will get eight seats and several small parties would take the remaining seats. Western diplomats have hinted that bringing the ultranationalist Croatian Party of Rights -- seen as "xenophobic and anti-European" -- into the governing coalition would not be welcomed."When forming the government I will keep in mind HSP's bad international image," Sanader has been quoted as saying. Talks with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) -- a member of the current ruling coalition -- could take place Wednesday, according to HSS leader Zlatko Tomcic. 
 The HSS will take nine seats in the incoming parliament, and Tomcic has signaled that he might consider joining a HDZ-led rightist coalition. The new parliament is likely to have 152 seats, one more than the previous parliament, but the final size depends on the number of votes cast by Croats living abroad. 
  NATO Defence Ministers Agree to Downsize BiH Force  02/12/2003 Citing significant progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina, NATO has decided to downsize its peacekeeping force there as a step towards the mission's possible termination and transfer to the EU.  (Washington Post - 02/12/03; AP, AFP, Reuters, BBC, NATO - 01/12/03; SFOR)NATO defence ministers agreed Monday (1 December) on a substantial reduction of the Alliance's peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) over the next six months, a step towards its possible termination by the end of 2004. 
 More than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim boys and men were killed after Srebrenica's fall, in what has been described as the worst atrocity against civilians since World War II.Following his guilty plea, Nikolic was convicted of persecution for his involvement in crimes against Bosnian Muslim civilians, including murder, cruel and inhumane treatment, terrorising, destruction of personal property and effects, and forcible transfer. A former teacher, he also admitted to having attended army meetings at which plans to execute Bosnian Muslims were openly discussed. During testimony in September in the trial of his two former army commanders, Vidoje Blagojevic and Dragan Jokic, Nikolic said that the Srebrenica massacre had been ordered by the top Bosnian Serb political and military leadership. 
 However, the Albanian National Council of Radio and Television (ANCRT) has levied fines and warned the operators to be careful and respect the law."The breach of the law seriously damages fair competition and discriminates against all the operators that respect the rules of a free market," the head of ANCRT, Sefedin Cela, told journalists. ANCRT has also requested that authorities assert control over the videocassette market, in order to stop the reproduction or sale of material in violation of copyright. The approval and implementation of the new law was demanded by the large television networks, which denounced smaller stations for broadcasting programmes and movies without the proper documentation. The ANCRT has encouraged the TV stations to work together in order to fill the vacuum of programmes and films created after the law took effect. 
 Forensic experts have said that as the first shot was fired, he was standing in front of the entrance to the building, facing the car. But that finding contradicts statements made by Djindjic's chief of security, Milan Veruovic, and seven other eyewitnesses who have said the prime minister was facing the government building. 
  FBI Director Reviews Olympic Security  04/12/2003 FBI Director Robert Mueller visited Athens last month for a brief security inspection of venues for next year's Olympics.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 04/12/03 FBI Director Robert Mueller honoured Greek law enforcement officials last month for their role in the break-up of November 17, the Greek terrorist group that has been blamed for 23 killings and many other attacks since 1975. 
 Four of the victims were US officials. Mueller gave awards to Police Chief Fotis Nasiakos, Anti-Terrorism Squad Chief Stelios Syros, Crime Lab Chief Efstratios Kyriakakis and Prosecutor Ioannis Diotis. 
 He also presented an award to police Lieutenant General Nikos Tasiopoulos for co-operating with the FBI over many years. Afterwards, Mueller flew over Athens by helicopter to inspect the Olympic venues, and was briefed on plans for protecting the Olympic infrastructure -- plans which are the responsibility of the Greek authorities in co-operation with a private Israeli company. 
 It remains unclear whether this applies to only Olympic venues or all areas of the city. Mueller was accompanied by four top FBI officers from the counterterrorism, organised crime and intelligence sections of the Bureau. 
 Meanwhile, the Athens daily  To Vima  published a State Department report that urges Greek authorities to be ready to confront a mass casualty terrorist attack. Athens will deploy more than 40,000 security staff during the Games, more than double the number in Sydney in 2000. 
  NATO Likely to Help Greece in Security Preparations for Athens Olympics  05/12/2003 In the wake of the recent terror attacks in Turkey, Greece has suggested that it might seek NATO's help in its security preparations for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.  (Forward - 05/12/03; AP, VOA, Canadian Press - 03/12/03; AP - 02/12/03; AP - 28/11/03; Reuters - 27/11/03)Greece has suggested that NATO could play a more direct role in security planning for the 2004 Summer Olympics. 
 Speaking after a security meeting headed by Prime Minister Costas Simitis, he said Greece could seek NATO's help in the planning of measures to step up its counterterrorism capacity. 
 The recent events, however, have shown us some new avenues," he said. Greek Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou has said that he would not like to see visitors left with "the impression that Athens is a military camp". 
 In addition, it has created a 200-member unit trained to deal specifically with biological, chemical and nuclear terrorism and is putting together a list of biochemical resources that it could get quickly in the event of an attack. In addition to its full co-operation with an international advisory group -- comprising Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Israel, Spain and the United States -- Athens has recently also intensified its security and intelligence co-operation with countries across the Balkans. 
  New Centre in BiH Trains Dogs to Find Mines  08/12/2003 A new US State Department-funded centre in Bosnia and Herzegovina trains dogs to sniff out mines, and will be training dogs to search for narcotics, making BiH a regional leader in this type of training.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 12/08/03 Excited barks echoed off the kennel walls and eight curly tails beat the air on a recent Saturday morning in November, as handfuls of people toured a row of dog kennels at the Southeast Europe Mine Detection Dog Centre. 
 The young dogs -- German or Belgian shepherds -- were anxious to play outside, not understanding that their games at the new centre will soon prevent hundreds of people in the region from losing a limb, or worse. At this remote spot a few kilometres up a two-track road from Konjic, in central Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), dog handlers at the 12-hectare centre train young dogs to sniff out landmines, which have killed 1,454 in BiH alone since 1996.According to senior dog trainer Clarke Young Jr., the dogs are trained to recognise C4 explosives and TNT, using a rubber ball to play a game as the dogs associate the explosive smell with the ball."The dogs are crazy about it -- they'd search through barbed wire, cactus, whatever, to find it," said Young, who has worked for project contractor Global Training Academy since 1990. 
 After a few weeks, the dogs practice searching the ground with mines in different configurations. 
 Finally, they learn to search and find nothing without getting frustrated, as teams often search suspected areas that are actually clean. 
 "I've noticed that a lot of organisations that don't use dogs have a higher accident rate."The BiH centre will eventually train up to 12 more dogs to sniff out narcotics and learn search and rescue operations, said centre director Arnold Sierra."One of the most important things we're doing is to train Bosnians to become the new Clarke," he said, adding that the centre would train eight more handlers. The dogs will be a welcome addition to mine-hunting in the region, said BiH Mine Action Centre deputy director Ahdin Orahovac."Next year we already expect results from the first generation of dogs," he said. 
 Many of the convicted are expected to get multiple life terms, when the three-judge panel announces sentences later in the week. The terrorist group began its reign of fear in 1975 with the murder of US Government official in Athens, Richard Welch. 
 Its last victim was the British defence attache in Athens, Stephen Saunders, in June 2000.The breakthrough in efforts to crack down on the terrorist group came last year, when a botched bombing attempt led to the arrest of Savas Xiros, the first suspected November 17 member to be held, and to the capture of the 18 others. Their trial opened in March and has been conducted in a specially built bunker-like prison courtroom. 
 Four defendants, including the only woman, were acquitted."Greek justice spoke today and its decisions are respected by all," said Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni, whose husband was among the group's victims. 
  An End to November 17 in Greece?  09/12/2003 With 15 top members of the November 17 terrorist organisation facing sentencing after being convicted, Greek officials and relatives of the some of the victims speak out.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 09/12/03 After 972 hours of sessions, an Athens court delivered a heavy blow to terrorism in Greece by court convicting 15 people of involvement in a series of murders and robberies carried out by the terrorist organisation November 17.Alexandros Giotopoulos, the mastermind of the organisation, was found guilty of planning and authorising about 2,000 crimes in connection with the radical group's 27-year history of violent attacks. 
 "They killed 23 people, but there are 23 widows, goodness knows how many children, how many parents; they will all carry this scar for the rest of their lives."The Greek government, looking ahead to 2004 Olympic Games, was expecting a positive result from the November 17 trial in order to convince the international community -- particularly the US -- that Greece is a devoted ally in the war against any kind of terrorism. 
 It was the period that political groups of the left and leftist origins opted for an armed struggle. Although the fall of the dictatorship in 1974 ushered in a constitutional democratic regime, some of the radical groups decided to carry on their struggle against the newborn political system. The origins of Greek terrorism date back to the 1960's in France, where Greek university students came to the conclusion that the only way to fight the dictators was through an armed struggle. 
 After the fall of the military junta, some of these people decided to carry on their fight, based on an ideology, which was a vague and unstructured mixture of Trotskyist, Maoist, Leninist, Marxist, and Guevarist ideals. In 1974 and 1975, terrorism emerged in Greece. 
 After a thorough study of November 17 attacks, it is obvious that the targets represented a socio-political status, which was opposed to the ideology of the terrorists. Major terrorist attacks of November 17-23/12/75: Assassination of US government official in Athens, Richard Welch-14/12/76: Assassination of former policeman Evangelos Mallios.-16/1/80: Assassination of Police Deputy Commander Pantelis Petrou and his driver Sotiris Stamoulis.-15/11/83: Assassination of US Navy Captain George Tsantes and his driver Nikos Veloutsos-3/4/84: Attempt of murder of US soldier, Sergeant Robert Chand.-21/2/85: Assassination of editor Nikos Momferatos and his driver Panagiotis Rousetis-26/11/85: Bombing of police bus, one policeman dead, 25 people wounded-8/4/86: Assassination of industrialist Dimitris Aggelopoulos-24/4/87: Bombing of a US Air Force bus.

  More than 5,000 Damaged Homes Restored in Macedonia's Former Crisis Regions  10/12/2003 More than 30m euros have been spent for the homes restored so far in Macedonia -- with the most generous donors being the Netherlands, the European Commission and Germany.  By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 10/12/03 Since the armed conflict in Macedonia ended in 2001, more than 5,000 out of 6,600 damaged homes have been repaired and restored."The reconstruction process has been carried out in two phases. 
 About 1,500 buildings in the 3rd and 4th categories of damage have been left for the second phaseAccording to Popovski, 33m euros were needed for the two phases. 
 The effort will also include restoration of forests and the provision of agricultural machines under favourable terms. Efforts will also be made to restore streetlights, water supplies and damaged schools and health care institutions. 
 Popovski announced a project to build police stations in the villages of Matejce and Aracinovo. 
 Sanader said he would present his cabinet for parliament's approval on 22 December, naming EU and NATO integration as some of his key priorities."My priorities are raising the living standards at home, gaining membership in NATO and the EU and resolving open issues with our neighbours," Sanader said following his meeting with Mesic. The HDZ, which will take 66 of the seats in the country's new 152-seat parliament, is expected to form a coalition government with a small centrist party, the Democratic Centre (DC) and, possibly, with the Social Liberal Party (HSLS).While voicing his party's support for the future government, HSLS leader Drazen Budisa said his party would decide on Saturday whether to join a HDZ-led coalition. 
 That reduced the number of children still living in residential care to about 37,000.According to the report, about 120 large institutions remained, but the majority had been restructured into family-type modules, where living conditions were described as "generally appropriate".The report also welcomed the methodology adopted for closing large residential institutions, as well as the establishment of 776 new units to provide alternative child-protective services."The reforms concerning the protection of children in orphanages are a major step forward but have still to bear fruit," the EC said in its annual report on Romania's accession progress. 
 The legislation, she said, would promote local adoptions, impose strict rules for post-adoption monitoring and improve children's rights. The EU has advised Romania against lifting the moratorium until new legislation on children's rights comes into force and the required administrative capacity is in place. The EU demanded a freeze on international adoptions following a report by the European Parliament's rapporteur for Romania, Emma Nicholson, condemning the practice as a "profitable trade in child trafficking". 
 With a population of 15 million and a key position in the region, the city has the kind of media presence eagerly sought by violent extremists."All must see with eyes wide open that the problem of terrorism is not local, it recognises no colour," said Ismet Sever, deputy chairman of the Union of Bulgarian and Turkish Businessmen, who lives in Istanbul. 
 They have attempted to rationalise their attacks by blaming Turkey for its relations with the United States and Israel. As a result, Turkey now seems to be caught "between the devil and the deep sea" -- the unpredictable devil of global terrorism and the deep sea of its European aspirations. 
 It adds, however, that anti-trafficking measures are not being implemented effectively and that long-term assistance for victims is lacking. Meanwhile, it warns, traffickers have adapted to actions taken by the authorities, using more sophisticated methods in carrying out their trade and making their activities less visible. As a result of weak law enforcement, there has been no real increase in the prosecution or sentencing of traffickers, the authors of the report conclude. 
  Foreign Ships to Be Listed in the Greek Ships' Register  15/12/2003 New legislation being prepared by the merchant marine ministry would boost the Greek shipping industry by allowing foreign ships to be listed in the national register.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 15/12/2003 A new opportunity has risen for enhancing the Greek shipping industry across all its levels: commercial, coastal and cruise. 
 "No census has the utmost accuracy, and this also goes for the 2002 census in Macedonia," said Hallgrimur Snorrason, the chairman of the high-level expert group. The government shares the assessment of foreign monitoring teams and experts that the census was conducted in a professional manner. Special EU representative Alexis Bruns, European Commission delegation head Donato Chiarini, US Ambassador Lawrence Butler, and the Ambassadors of the OSCE and NATO missions in Macedonia, Carlos Manuel Duran Pais and Nicholas Bigman, are among those who have backed the census results, saying they believe the data released by the National Statistics Office is accurate. For Ali Ahmeti's Democratic Union of Integration (DUI), such international support is decisive. 
 The premises had been rented as a detergent factory, police said."Every once in a while we saw men carrying bags in and out. 
 He had not seen anyone in the shop recently, he added. Local press reports said Yitiz fled Istanbul three days before the synagogue bombings. Early Sunday, an armoured vehicle escorted by a convoy of police cars took a hand-cuffed Yitiz -- described as being about 30 years old, with dark hair and a short beard -- to the workshop for reconstruction of the crime scene, a standard procedure in the Turkish investigative process. Police sources said Yitiz has admitted to having hired the four suicide bombers -- all Turkish nationals. 
 "During his interrogation, the suspect said that he had training on war techniques, bomb making, usage of heavy weapons in a camp under the control of radical organisations in an Asian country in 1994," the Istanbul Security Directorate said in a statement. The statement noted that a total of 94 people have been interrogated so far, and 31 of them have been detained because of alleged connections to the terrorist attacks. The Turkish daily  Milliyet  reported that Yitiz had been trained in Afghanistan. 
 Last month, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Chechens and Turks linked to the al-Qaeda network were involved in the preparation of the explosive devices used in the blasts. On Sunday, the death toll from the four attacks rose to 62 after a 31-year-old computer expert, identified as Selahattin Yildirim, died in hospital from injuries sustained in the bombing at the HSBC bank. 
 The barracks served as an industrial site during the Yugoslav era, but is now once again inhabited by Turkish soldiers -- this time, as part of a peace mission. Ozkok met with political and military figures briefly and then toured the city centre of Prizren where he was surrounded by hundreds of people who cheered and waved Turkish flags. 
 There are thought to be 10,000 Turks in the city of 120,000.Turkey has long been eager to join peacekeeping missions and has sent troops to Somalia, Albania, BiH, Kosovo and Afghanistan. 
 Officials at Hamburg International and Euro Koha -- the joint winners of the tender for the Kosovo Airlines Company -- say that one airplane is already painted with the official logo. President Ibrahim Rugova and Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi attended the opening ceremony. 
 "At the beginning, we'll have one airplane then later we will engage the second one, and if the necessity arises, we will have the third one also. 
 Kosovo Airlines is employing Boeing 737s, which are equiped with 148 seats and are three years old. One problem the airline has run into is the civil aviation office in Pristina. 
 He is expected to shed light on the former Yugoslav strongman's role in the 1990s Balkan conflicts.  (The New York Times, Washington Post - 16/12/03; AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC, CNN, VOA, RFE/RL - 15/12/03)Former NATO Commander General Wesley Clark testified behind closed doors Monday (15 December) in Slobodan Milosevic's war crimes trial at The Hague, becoming the most senior US official to give evidence against the former Yugoslav president. 
 Clark was also a member of the US delegation, led by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, during negotiations in 1995 on the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In his book "Waging Modern War: Bosnia, Kosovo and the Future of Combat", Clark said not only did Milosevic command the police, but that when other Serb leaders disagreed with his instructions, he "worked around them, skipping echelons in the chain of command to drop down and give specific orders".Under the agreement between Washington and the tribunal, US representatives will be allowed to review his statements and ask that passages deemed harmful to US national interests be removed from the official records. 
  Turkish Cypriot Election Ends in Draw  17/12/2003 The election that was seen as a referendum on the UN plan results in no government as the rivals refuse to form a coalition with each other.  By Mustafa Azizoglu for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 17/12/03 The Turkish Cypriot election resulted in deadlock with two rival blocs both winning 25 seats in the 50-seat parliament. 
 The pro-reunification Republican Turkish Party (CTP) gained 19 seats Sunday (14 December) with 35.18 per cent of the votes and emerged as the winner of the election. 
 The ruling National Unity Party (UBP), which opposes UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan to reunite the island, won 18 seats with 32.93 per cent of the vote. 
 The Democrat Party (DP) -- allied with UBP -- obtained 7 seats, and the Peace and Democracy Movement (BDH) -- allied with CTP -- won 6 seats. 
 Even though the pro-EU bloc had 48 per cent of the vote against 46 per cent for parties that support Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, they could not get the majority of seats in parliament because of a complex electoral system. Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu resigned on Tuesday to allow "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" leader Denktash to start talks on forming a new cabinet. 
 Negotiations with leaders of the four parties that won seats in the new assembly are expected to start Wednesday. The pro-EU parties agreed to negotiate reunification with the Greek side of the island using a UN blueprint prepared by and named after Annan. 
 Given a 20-year statute of limitation in Greece, the first four murders committed by 17 November were left unpunished. Last week, authorities welcomed the court's verdicts against the 15 members of the group, seeing the move as removal of the biggest security threat ahead of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Authorities have stressed that the core of the militant group has been destroyed, but indicate more arrests could follow. 
 The cities of Perrenjas, Librazhd, Elbasan, Cerrik, Lushnje and Fier will be along the route to the southern port of Vlora. The ministry of industry and power and local authorities in the cities involved would be responsible for the implementation of the project, Islami said. The IMF, the World Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation of the United States (OPIC), the Washington-based Ex/Im Bank and the EBRD have expressed interest in providing financial support to the construction of the pipeline. The oil will come from Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan with European and North American markets as the final destination. The cost for the construction of AMBO pipeline is estimated at $1.13 billion. 
 There also are taxes on estate turnover and rights, gifts and heritage, and fees for arrangement of construction land."Efforts are being made to enable the municipalities to get a part of the central taxes such as VAT, profit tax and personal income tax," he said. Skopje as a separate local self-government unit will have a different organisational structure because the current way leads to non-functionality and overlapping of responsibilities between the city and municipalities. 
 Instead of municipalities, Skopje would be divided into quarters or districts where citizens decide on the issues related to their quarter while the city decides on the issues related to its citizens on the whole. 
  Clark: Milosevic Had Advance Knowledge of Srebrenica Massacre  19/12/2003 Slobodan Milosevic had advance knowledge of Bosnian Serb plans to massacre Muslims in Srebrenica, former NATO Commander General Wesley Clark told the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.  (The New York Times, Washington Post, Independent, Electronic Telegraph - 19/12/03; AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC, CNN, FT, VOA - 18/12/03)Slobodan Milosevic knew in advance that Bosnian Serbs were planning a massacre in Srebrenica, retired General Wesley Clark told the UN war crimes tribunal, according to a transcript of his testimony made public Thursday (18 December).Under an agreement between Washington and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Clark testified behind closed doors for more than 10 hours on Monday and Tuesday. 
  Bulgaria Approves Hosting of US, NATO Military Bases  22/12/2003 Bulgaria's Parliament has given the green light for the possible establishment of US and NATO military bases in the country.  (Washington Times - 22/12/03; Novinite, Dnevnik - 21/12/03; AFP, Reuters, RFE/RL, BTA, BBC, Mediapool, Dnevnik, Bulgarian Parliament - 19/12/03)Bulgaria's Parliament has adopted a declaration supporting the possible establishment of US and NATO military bases in the country. 
 Expert consultations on the process are expected to begin in January. The declaration, adopted Friday (19 December) without debate, was backed by 200 of the MPs in Bulgaria's unicameral 240-seat legislature. 
 US forces used Bulgaria's Sarafovo Black Sea airbase to refuel Iraq-bound aircraft during the campaign against Saddam Hussein's regime last spring. 
 Quoting unnamed sources, the  Washington Times  reported Monday that the Pentagon is keen to build an air base at Sarafovo. Analysts believe that hosting bases would bring economic benefits to Bulgaria and Romania, which are hoping to join the EU in 2007. 
 They follow the break-up of DOS, the 18-party coalition that managed to bring down Slobodan Milosevic in October 2000.Although democratic parties are expected again to win the majority of seats, inter-party bickering will most likely hamper formation of the government. 
 But Kostunica is not satisfied with the changes, and says that he will not be able to form a new government with the Democrats. The third democratic force expected to win seats in the legislature is G17 Plus, led by former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus and former National Bank of Serbia Governor Mladjan Dinkic. 
  US Freezes Assets of BiH-Based Charity  23/12/2003 The United States has named a BiH-based charity and its director as suspected sponsors of international terrorism.  (Washington Post - 23/12/03; Reuters, AP, AFP, Dow Jones - 22/12/03)The governments of the United States and Saudi Arabia moved on Monday (22 December) to freeze the assets of Vazir, an organisation registered in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
 It is headed by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who has pledged to advance Croatia's EU and NATO accession and boost the economy. Eighty-eight of the MPs in the country's new 152-seat parliament voted in favour of the new government, while 29 voted against it and 14 abstained. Sanader's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has returned to power after almost four years in opposition. 
 Having won 66 of the parliamentary seats in the 23 November elections, it fell short of securing a 77-seat outright majority. 
 A total of 35 people have been charged so far.  (Reuters, AFP, BBC - 26/12/03; AFP, AP - 25/12/03; BBC - 24/12/03)The group behind the November suicide bombings in Istanbul has been broken up, city governor Muammer Guler said at a news conference Friday (26 December). 
 Five days later, similar attacks targeted the British consulate and the offices of the London-based HSBC bank in the city. 
 The resulting police investigation has resulted in the arrests of dozens of suspects."The suicide attacks were carried out by elements trying to organise for al-Qaeda in Turkey," Guler said. 
 Simply put, the zeroes in the lira do not fit in computers, calculators, bills and checks. With a draft law that was recently sent to the cabinet for approval, the government will remove six zeros from the lira. 
  Nationalists Win Serbia's Election  29/12/2003 Serbia's ultranationalists won the most seats in Sunday's legislative elections, but fell short of the majority needed to form a government.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 29/12/03 Following Sunday's (28 December) early elections in Serbia, the democratic pro-European parties will have a majority in the new parliament, but will likely have a difficult time forming a government, due to past differences. Vojislav Kostunica leads the strongest reformist party, the Democratic Party of Serbia. 
 The other reform parties are G17 Plus, led by former Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, and the coalition of the Serbian Renewal Movement and Nova Serbia. The far-right Serbian Radical Party -- whose leader, Vojislav Seselj, currently lives in an International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prison cell -- won the most seats in the legislature but fell short of the number needed to form a government. 
 The party based its campaign on a pledge to halt the extradition of Serbs to the ICTY.With 71 per cent of returns counted, the Serbian Electoral Commission said the Radical Party stood to get 81 seats in parliament. 
  Romania Trying to Deal with Rising Cyber-crime  29/12/2003 Seeking to clear its image as a haven for computer-related fraud and other criminal activities, Romania has adopted one of the harshest cyber laws in the world and has created a special cyber-crime unit.  (Washington Times - 29/12/03; BBC - 27/12/03; Internet Fraud Complaint Centre)Economic hardships and poor employment opportunities have encouraged computer-savvy Romanians to employ their skills in online fraud, earning for their country the reputation of being a hub for cyber-crime."It's one of the leading places for this kind of activity," a  Washington Times  report on Monday (29 December) quoted Gabrielle Burger, the head of the FBI's office in Bucharest, as saying. According to a report by the US Internet Fraud Complaint Centre (IFCC) -- a partnership between the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Centre -- on Internet fraud in 2002, Romania ranked fifth in the world by percentage of perpetrators of cyber-crime, ahead of other European nations, such as Spain and Russia. 
 The total dollar loss from all referred cases of fraud was $54m, up from $17m in 2001.The IFCC identifies nine Internet fraud categories, including auction fraud, gaming fraud, communications fraud and business fraud. Romanian cyber-criminals are also said to be working in collaboration with European and US accomplices to rob consumers and companies of millions of dollars each year through false Internet purchases and cash extortion after hacking into companies' systems, as well as through the dissemination of computer viruses and worms."There's a significant number of very talented, very inventive hackers inside Romania who, you know, are good at scamming people elsewhere," the BBC quoted Andrew McLaughlin of Harvard University's Berkman Centre for Internet and Society as saying. 
 Joint operations have led to the arrest of more than 60 Romanians, including two suspects involved in an extortion attempt against the South Pole Research Centre last May. 
 Such a government, the EU said, will get the bloc's full support. Welcoming Sunday's "peaceful, free and fair" parliamentary elections, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana voiced confidence Monday that "the necessary basis exists for a relaunch of the reform efforts, for further progress towards Europe and for a continuation of the successful policy of good neighbourliness".Six parties -- four pro-democracy political forces and the parties of two war crimes indictees -- have passed the 5 per cent threshold for entry into the new 250-seat parliament. 
 With about 95 per cent of votes counted, the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) of former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica is on track to get 52 parliamentary seats, the strongest representation among the pro-reform parties. 
 The Democratic Party has won 37 seats and G17 Plus won 34. 
 The Serbian Renewal Movement - New Serbia coalition garnered 23.The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of detained war crimes suspect Vojislav Seselj will be the largest parliamentary party with 81 seats. 
 The Socialist Party of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is currently on trial in The Hague, is said to have won 22 seats. In a statement Monday, Solana said that while "extremist nationalist forces" in Serbia appeared to have been strengthened as a result of the vote, he believed they would not be able to form a government."I appeal to all democratic forces to work together in order to ensure that a new government based on a clear and strong European reform agenda can be formed rapidly," Solana said. 
  Turkey Gets Ready For A New Round Of Talks On Cyprus  05/01/2004 Aiming to restart the negotiations on the Cyprus issue and find a solution before 1 May 2004, Ankara has prepared a new proposal of modifications to Kofi Annan's plan  By Mustafa Azizoglu for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 05/01/04 As the leaders of Northern Cyprus go in search of a new government following the 14 December elections, which ended in a draw, Turkey is seeking to clarify its stance on UN chief Kofi Annan's plan and target a solution for reuniting the divided island before 1 May. 
 The Turkish government, still stumbling in search of EU human rights standards, believes that resolving the Cyprus issue will strengthen its position prior to the Dublin summit, set for December 2004, at which Turkey will press for a date to start negotiation talks. The proposed modifications to the Annan Plan address three areas: protecting Turkey's guarantor status on the island, restricting migration between sides and reinforcing bi-zonality. 
 The current plan would oblige some Turkish villagers to pass through Greek areas to go from one Turkish village to another, officials say; thus, the border should be straightened. 
  Romania Outlines Priorities as Non-Permanent Security Council Member  05/01/2004 Romania's two-year term on the UN Security Council confirms the country's new international status, according to Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana  (Rompres -- 29/12/03 - 03/01/04; RFE/RL, AP - 24/10/03)The Balkans, the Middle East and Central Asia are among Romania's top priorities as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, according to Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana. Romania, along with Algeria, Benin, Brazil and the Philippines, began a two-year term on the Security Council Thursday (1 January), replacing Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and Syria. 
 "There isn't a city or a village where people do not complain about the government's claim that it has no money to pay the doctors, professors and others, and then, overnight, 35m euros is reimbursed to Karic, and not only the principal, but interest as well," he added. According to Labus, the new government will have the same task the previous one had three years ago: to decide what to do with the "dirty money" and people who made excess profit. Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic, meanwhile, vowed that Karic would pay the one-off tax, attributing the problem to setbacks in the lustration process. 
 Major foreign investors care more about the honesty of courts than about cheap labour. Corruption decreases the national GDP by approximately 0.9 per cent to 1.2 per cent annually, according to data from the Market Economy Institute. 
 The results of a recent sociological survey conducted by Vitosha Research show that most bribes rarely surpass 250 Bulgarian leva, and it is more a question of saving time than any material advantage. The enormous amount of permits and patents required by Bulgarian law -- three times more than those required in EU countries -- are at the root of corruption practices, experts say. 
 Any decisions on a possible NATO role in Iraq would likely come later, following political developments there. De Hoop Scheffer plans to visit capitals of the current and the incoming NATO member countries, with trips to Washington, London, Paris and Berlin already planned for the coming weeks. 
 However, the centre is still not operational.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 08/01/04 Albania, Italy, Greece and Germany signed an agreement last month concerning the anti-trafficking centre in the southern port city of Vlora, Albania. The document urges the centre to improve the collection of information about illegal trafficking of any kind, including drug and gun trafficking -- activities which continue to plague Italy, Greece and other European countries. Albanian Minister of Public Order Igli Toska, Italian Ambassador Attilo Massimo Iannucci, Greek Ambassador Dimitrios Iliopoulos, and German Ambassador Hans-Peter Annen signed the agreement. The memorandum aims to pave the way towards launching centre operations, including the collection of funds and co-ordination of efforts. Speaking as representative of an initiator country for establishment of the centre and also representing Italy during its EU presidency, Iannuci said he appreciates the contributions of the Albanian government and ministry of public order. Toska thanked the representatives of other countries that are partners in the anti-trafficking centre. 
 Foreign Minister George Papandreou is expected to succeed him in the post.  (AP, Reuters, BBC, Financial Times - 07/01/04; AP, Athens News Agency - 06/01/04; FT, AFP, Macedonian Press Agency, eKathimerini - 05/01/04; BTA - 04/01/04; Athens News - 02/01/04)Greece will hold parliamentary elections on 7 March, Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Wednesday (7 January) as he announced his resignation as leader of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). 
 A shorter election campaign would both minimise disruptions in the country's preparations for the Athens Olympics in August, as well as allow the incoming government to focus on arrangements for the Games. As party leader, Papandreou could become the third member of his family -- after his father and grandfather, also called George Papandreou -- to lead the country. 
  Talks on New Serbian Government to Resume  09/01/2004 The pro-democracy parties that won seats in Serbia's new parliament have not reached agreement on forming the new government. 
 The results of that vote give the four parties a combined 147-seat parliamentary majority. 
 The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of detained UN war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj will be the single largest party in the legislature, having won 82 of 250 parliamentary seats. The DSS came in second, making it the largest party among the four in the democratic bloc, with 53 deputies. 
 Its leader, former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, is considered the leading candidate for prime minister. One option is for Kostunica to form a government around the democratic leaders who together overthrew former President Slobodan Milosevic, whose Socialist Party will take 22 of the parliamentary seats. 
 Some have suggested that the move was meant to scare the other democratic parties into accepting his terms. Kostunica's idea was criticised by Western officials, who called on the reformers to seek agreement and prevent a resurgence of ultra nationalism in Serbia. 
  SFOR Searches for Karadzic in Former Bosnian Serb Stronghold  12/01/2004 SFOR troops have confiscated documents and ammunition from Radovan Karadzic's house in Pale. 
 Two people were detained for questioning."We searched two premises this morning, including the house of Radovan Karadzic, but found no evidence that he was there," SFOR spokesman Lieutenant Matthew Brock said Sunday (11 January).The operation, which began early Saturday and is expected to end Monday, targets indicted war crimes suspects and their supporters. NATO-led peacekeepers arrived in Pale, about 16 km southeast of Sarajevo, after receiving a tip, which suggested the wartime Bosnian Serb leader might be in need of medical help. 
 They searched all medical facilities in the town, including the medical practice of Karadzic's daughter, Sonja, as well as a church, a cultural centre and private buildings. 
 They also set up checkpoints and searched vehicles. Brock did not disclose the amount of weapons and ammunition confiscated from the home of Karadzic's wife, Liljana. 
 He said he hoped the documentation found during the house search "would lead to success in our future operations".Captain Dennis Thaagaard, who took part in the sweep, said peacekeepers found evidence that Karadzic "had contacted his family and his inner support network".During the operation, peacekeepers detained two people. 
 "We will leave no stone unturned, we will search every forest to find them and send them where they belong, to The Hague tribunal," he said. 
 The new cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Fatos Nano and voted in by parliament during the final days of 2003, is making European integration a top priority. Authorities are being more careful this time about making promises, and are not offering deadlines for the completion of the SAA with the EU.The country still must implement reforms that will pave the way for its economic future. 
 The meeting was held on the day of national mourning for 21 would-be emigrants who died in the Ionian Sea. President Alfred Moisiu, meanwhile, is emphasising the positive, pointing to enhanced regional co-operation, Albania's contribution to the fight against international terrorism, the opening of the SAA negotiations, and the beatification of Mother Teresa."In general, Albania's image in the world, despite ups and downs, moved in a positive direction," Moisiu said. 
 "This is the proof to the EU of our good will."The Union is also pressing Zagreb to resolve its long-standing row with neighbouring Slovenia over their common sea border in the northern Adriatic."I told the prime minister the same wording I told the Slovenian prime minister: 'behave'," European Commission (EC) President Romano Prodi told reporters after his meeting with Sanader. 
  BiH Capital Declared the First Intercultural City  14/01/2004 Although still bearing the wounds of interethnic conflict, Sarajevo's unique forms of intercultural tolerance make the city ideal for the Council of Europe's project of intercultural dialogue and conflict prevention.  By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 14/01/04 The Special Representative of the Secretary General of Council of Europe, Sonja Moser-Starrach, officially declared Sarajevo to be the first Intercultural City of the Council of Europe on 10 December in the BiH capital. The symbolic act is part of a pilot project based on the Council of Europe's Declaration on Intercultural Dialogue and Conflict Prevention. 
 Sarajevo will bear the title of Intercultural City until December 2004. 
 During those 12 months it will host cultural conferences, festival events and debates, all aimed at fostering broader dialogue among different cultures. According to Moser-Starrach, "the city of Sarajevo is honoured with the title because of its unique tradition of the most different forms of tolerance."The president of the Sarajevo-based International Centre for Peace, Ibrahim Spahic, and BiH Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lidija Topic launched the Intercultural City initiative jointly. 
 "Our city came into focus of interest because of the fact that the very idea of the Declaration on Intercultural Dialogue and Conflict Prevention is identical to all the historical events that Sarajevo passed through in the last century and through which it is passing today.""Sarajevo really deserves the title because of the fact that in the beginning of the 1990s, it was the symbol of victims, while today it is the symbol of reconstruction in all aspects", said BiH Minister of Civil Affairs Safet Halilovic. The official promotion of the project and the declaration of the BiH capital as the first Intercultural City took place at the opening ceremony of the three-day International Forum in Sarajevo. 
 Several art exhibits were also organised, and local religious leaders addressed participants. According to Spahic, several key institutions supported the project of Sarajevo as the Intercultural City. 
  Interpol Study: Greece Has Lowest Crime Rate in Europe  15/01/2004 Statistics published recently by Interpol indicate that Greece has by far the lowest crime rate in Europe, making it among the safest countries in which to live or visit.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 15/01/04 Studies published by Interpol indicate that Greece has the lowest crime rate in Europe, making it among the safest countries in which to live or visit. 
 That does not come as a surprise, since it is an international passage for criminals between Europe, Africa and Asia. According to economist Ilias Ioakimoglou, who has more recent statistics than those published by Interpol, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and France follow in second to sixth place. 
 In view of the Olympic Games that will take place in Athens this August, the media have been pointing out inefficiencies in security, leading some to worry that the country cannot deal with threats. Greece has invested 597m euros in security for the Games, the highest amount for any single event ever. 
 The OSCE will focus on legislative and judicial reform, including property reform; regional administrative reform; electoral reform; parliamentary capacity-building; anti-trafficking and anti-corruption activities, including support for the implementation of relevant national strategies; developing media legislation; promoting good governance and projects to strengthen civil society; and police assistance, particularly training for border police. The OSCE will continue to provide its assistance and expertise in close consultation with the government and other state institutions and will co-operate with other international organisations and institutions to ensure effectiveness and avoid duplication. 
 That, he says, is why a new mandate is needed."If you look at them carefully, they have nothing to do with the drastic positive changes in the country, with the numerous projects that the Presence is running and also with the tendency that Albania is following now," Mazi added, emphasising that the organisation still has a significant role to play in the country. 
 The spate of layoffs is continuing this year: 4,000 people are expected to lose their jobs in a bid to shrink the civil service."It is clear that one cannot create jobs without new investment and a real 5 per cent growth," Labour Minister Jovan Manasievski says, arguing that the issue must be addressed using long-term analysis built on the European methodology model. To that end, the Socioeconomic Council has approved a National Employment Plan for 2004 and 2005, drafted by foreign experts funded by the EU CARDS programme. 
  Implementing Existing Commitments Tops Bulgaria's OSCE Chairmanship Agenda  19/01/2004 Implementation of OSCE commitments will be the top priority during Bulgaria's chairmanship of the 55-nation organisation in 2004, the country's foreign minister said.  (OSCE, RFE/RL, VOA, Novinite, Mediapool, Dnevnik, Washington File - 15/01/04)Pledging adherence to continuity, Bulgaria has said that implementation of OSCE commitments will be a top priority during its chairmanship of the 55-nation organisation in 2004. 
 The number of visitors from the CIS increased around 24.7 per cent, while those from eastern European countries increased 18.7 per cent, compared to 2002.According to tourism experts, an effective promotion campaign by the tourism ministry and successful marketing by travel agencies were key to the success. Culture and Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu predicted that his country will host 20 million tourists over the next three years, resulting in 24 billion euros in revenue by 2010.Mumcu says he plans to launch a campaign in the fast-growing health tourism industry, directed primarily at European countries with aging populations and a lack of care options. As part of the campaign, the ministry will increase the number of thermal water facilities used to relieve pain caused by chronic diseases such as rheumatism and calcification. 
 All are said to be Serb nationals. Special Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic issued the indictments against them in early December, charging them with killing 200 Croat and other non-Serb prisoners at the Ovcara farm near the eastern Croatian town of Vukovar. 
 Two days later, about 300 men that sought refuge in the hospital were transported under Serbian Army guard to the Ovcara farm outside the town, where soldiers beat them for several hours. 
 The three are currently in custody at The Hague, awaiting trial. During a visit to Belgrade in May, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said some war crimes suspects could be tried by local courts after Serbia adopts the necessary legislation. 
 Major exercises are scheduled for February and March to test security preparations.  (Reuters, The Washington Times - 19/01/04; AP - 18/01/04; Washington Post - 17/01/04; VOA, The Guardian - 16/01/04; BBC - 15/01/04)Describing security as the highest priority issue in the organisation of the 2004 Athens Olympics, Greek officials have assured the United States that comprehensive precautionary measures have been planned to ensure a safe environment for the Games. 
 Preparations will be put to the test during exercises due to take place in February and March. Greek Public Order Minister Giorgos Floridis, accompanied by the country's intelligence chief, Lucas Apostolides, and the national police head, Fotios Nasiakos, arrived on a two-day visit to Washington on Thursday (15 January) to brief US officials on Olympic security preparations. 
 The talks reportedly also focused on co-operation in fighting terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking."In the post-September 11 world, the Greek government has accorded Olympic security the highest priority by committing unprecedented resources," the Greek embassy in Washington said in a statement on the delegation's visit. The November suicide bombings in Istanbul that killed 62 people and injured more than 700 brought new security concerns for the Athens Olympics. A budget of roughly 638m euros underpins the planned measures to ensure the protection of athletes and spectators. 
 Greece is also planning to deploy about 50,000 security personnel, including police and soldiers, during the Olympics, and will erect twin concrete barriers around the Olympic Village equipped with cameras and x-ray machines. The security plan for the Games, which run from 13 August to 29 August, was drawn up in co-operation with seven countries -- Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Israel, Spain and the United States. 
 NATO is expected to provide air cover during the Games. The United States, according to a  Washington Times  report, is granting the International Atomic Energy Agency $500,000 for radiation detectors to be used at Olympic events and is helping the Greeks install both portable and fixed radiation detectors at border crossings and other locations. British, French, Spanish and US security experts have assisted in training thousands of Greek police officers on dealing with terrorist attacks and explosives, while Israelis have provided training on handling suicide bombers. The two major drills in February and March will also help identify possible loopholes and vulnerabilities ahead of the Games. 
 But the real challenge may be getting governments and people to respect its decisions, given BiH's short and patchy history of respect for human rights."People thought, 'Never mind, that's only something written, I don't really care, I won't accept it,'" he said of past decisions. 
 The EU says this will happen when they have made the necessary reforms. On Tuesday, the Union urged Albania to step up efforts to carry out those reforms and maintain internal political stability as preconditions for progress in the SAA process."It is critically important that Albania is making progress soon," European Commission President Romano Prodi told visiting Prime Minister Fatos Nano. Commending Tirana for its constructive role in the region and help in the process of the Western Balkan countries' integration, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana reiterated the need for authorities to make a "rapid and tangible progress in the fight against organised crime and corruption". 
 Since these offices have not yet been computerised, only babies born starting in January of this year will be supplied with IDs. 
 The civil offices will issue identification for other citizens during a later phase, following computerisation and creation of the National Civil Register. Each ID number will be exclusive to the person assigned it. 
 The next day, he will meet with Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denktas, hours before leaving for Washington for talks with US President George W. Bush. 
 He said Wednesday that Erdogan was planning to move towards the relaunch of negotiations and would seek Washington's support for this initiative. 
 She added that the draft should differentiate between missing civilians and missing soldiers. The law is important not only because the families lobbied for it, but because it outlines merging the entity groups that conduct exhumations -- the Federation Commission for Missing Persons and the Republika Srpska (RS) Office of Missing Persons -- into a single, state-level organisation. Such a merger would mean that searching for the missing would no longer depend on ethnicity. 
 If that plan is passed, and NATO trusts that it will be carried out energetically, I would say aggressively, then you are close to something spectacular," Biegman said. 
 About 9,000 police and municipality personnel were mobilised and rescue teams rushed to help people stranded in their cars. 
 "Istanbul is going through a hardship unseen in 50 years."Extreme currents and low visibility due to the high winds and heavy snow forced the Turkish authorities to close the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, blocking the passage of dozens of oil tankers through the key shipping lanes. In Bulgaria, authorities temporarily closed the Black Sea port of Varna. 
 More than 100 villages and towns were reported without power Friday. 
 Conditions have gradually improved, however, and authorities said Sunday that only six villages still have power problems, while another 12 are awaiting restoration of their power supply. Romanian officials, meanwhile, said the worst snows in 20 years left tens of thousands without electricity. 
 Sea and river transport is returning to normal as Black Sea and Danube River ports resume operations. Greece was also hit by the bad weather, and a state of emergency was declared on the northern island of Limnos. 
 In addition, a Greek-owned freighter with 17 crewmembers on board sank in rough waters in the Aegean Sea about 120 nautical miles west of Crete early Friday. 
  Albanians Hope for Liberalised Visa Regime  27/01/2004 Following the recent tragedy in the Ionian Sea, some Albanian politicians are calling for an easing of visa restrictions. 
 This contribution was based on improvement of border management in order to make Albanian territory safe and not a transit place for illegal trafficking," Bimo said. According to statistics from the ministry of labour and social issues, more than 22 per cent of the population has left Albania for a better life, many choosing a risky journey to the Italian coast via boat. 
 The Coalition for Tolerance -- formed by significant political parties of Hungarians and Bosniaks, two major ethnic minorities in Serbia -- did not win the required 5 per cent of votes in the 28 December parliamentary election. International organisations consider the Serbian election law inadequate, as it fails to protect minorities' rights by way of "positive discrimination", ensuring parliamentary seats for all ethnic groups. 
 Those include the Democratic Party, which allocated two MP seats to Bosniaks for their support. According to Kasza, the December elections did not result in Serbia moving towards Europe, rather Belgrade "took three steps back" as a result of the strong showing by the ultranationalist Radical Party. 
 In Subotica, a city in northern Vojvodina, the statue of Matija Gubac was knocked over on two occasions, while the editorial office of Serbia's only Croat language weekly,  Hrvatska Rec  (Croat Voice), received anonymous threats. According to Zvonimir Perusic, the magazine's editor, these and other incidents add up to an attack against a particular national minority. Last week, the president of the Council of Seven Nations in Vojvodina issued an urgent call for changes to the election law, allowing national minorities to receive representation in the Serbian Parliament. 
 The defence has reserved the right to recommend a sentence during the sentencing hearing. Babic was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in November 2003 on one count of crimes against humanity for persecutions on political, racial, and religious grounds, and four counts of violations of the laws or customs of war, including murder, cruel treatment, wanton or militarily unnecessary destruction of villages, and destruction or damage to educational or religious institutions. In May 1991 Babic, a dentist by profession, became president of the self-declared Serbian Autonomous District Krajina, later re-named Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). 
 "However, revenue shortfalls persist, and could compromise the programme's poverty reduction objectives," he added. Carstens said improving revenue mobilisation is a policy priority, requiring not only improvements in tax administration and in tax policy design, but also actions to enhance governance and the business climate in order to reduce the size of the informal economy and widen the tax net. 
 The Albanian government is committed to economic reforms, reducing the informal economy, strengthening its fight against corruption and supporting the private sector, Malaj said. The government also announced the successful conclusion of negotiations in Washington with the World Bank, the European Bank of Investments and the EBRD for disbursement of a loan to build a thermo-central facility in the city of Vlora. According to the agreement, three banks will offer $100m, while the Albanian Power Corporation will invest $12m for the first phase of construction. 
  Croatian Government Works to Rebuild Relations With US  29/01/2004 With a view to joining the EU and NATO, Croatia's new government is looking to Washington for support. 
 They are now focusing on another foreign policy priority -- rebuilding bilateral relations with Washington. Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul, who served two terms as the Croatian ambassador to the United States, said at a recent press conference that the new government has five strategic goals in diplomacy. 
 They spent a week in Washington, meeting with lawmakers and officials at the State Department and Pentagon. One of the crucial questions in relations between Croatia and the United States is the signing of Article 98 that would exclude US citizens from extradition to the International Criminal Court. 
 The two also discussed Cyprus and the war on terrorism.  (FT, Washington Post, The Washington Times, International Herald Tribune - 29/01/04; AP, AFP, Reuters, VOA, EUpolitix, Anadolu Agency, The White House, Washington File - 28/01/04)Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed assurances from President George W. Bush that the United States does not support expanded Kurdish autonomy in northern Iraq. 
 "There is no place for terrorism or terrorist organisations in the new Iraq," he added. The war on terrorism and latest developments in efforts towards the reunification of Cyprus were other major items on the agenda of between Bush and Erdogan in Washington. Describing Turkey as "a friend and an important ally of America", the US president voiced appreciation for Erdogan's commitment to stopping terrorism. 
 That needs to be mutual and international, especially in the aftermath of what happened on September 11th", Erdogan said, adding that Ankara and Washington "are in a common effort".On Cyprus, Bush expressed appreciation for Erdogan's efforts towards a resolution of the long-standing dispute over the Mediterranean island. 
 Remember that the terrorists involved in the 9/11 atrocity had connections in several European countries -- BiH not among them -- and in the United States itself. 
 We need to get the State Information and Protection Agency fully functioning and we need to consider if the 13 or 14 different police services that we currently have in BiH can provide the most effective protection against this type of threat. SE Times : How important is the reform of Mostar City Administration for the whole of BiH and how will the reform be achieved? Paddy Ashdown : It is crucial. 
 Two large issues -- the electoral system and the city administration -- remain unresolved. 
  UNMIK Deputy Head: Kosovo Provides Lessons in Preventing Ethnic Cleansing  02/02/2004 Kosovo is a good example of the steps the international community can take to stop ethnic cleansing and prevent its reoccurrence, says UNMIK's deputy head.  (UN, Washington File, AFP - 28/01/04)The 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo provided lessons about the kind of international efforts needed to prevent ethnic conflicts, UNMIK deputy head Jean-Christian Cady has said."Kosovo is a good example of what the international community and the UN can achieve to stop ethnic cleansing and build policy instruments that will prevent it from occurring again," Cady said Wednesday (28 January) in Stockholm, addressing an international forum on preventing genocide. The success of efforts in this area, he said, required "a clear and common will of the international community to stop ethnic cleansing". 
 The conservative DSS, the strongest among four democratic parties that won seats in December's parliamentary elections, sought the Socialists' support after weeks of talks on a new government resulted in a deadlock. Citing "national interests", SPS leaders indicated after talks Monday with the DSS that their party, officially led by detained war crimes indictee Slobodan Milosevic, would likely support the conservatives' parliamentary speaker candidate. 
 He also ruled out the possibility of further coalition talks with the Democratic Party (DS), another of the four political forces in the democratic bloc. The DSS, the DS, the G17 Plus and the Serbian Renewal Movement-New Serbia (SPO-NS) coalition together won a 146-seat majority in the 250-seat legislature. 
 The SRS holds 82 seats, while Milosevic's Socialists have 22.After several rounds, coalition talks among the four parties in the democratic bloc fell apart. 
 It has insisted that all institutional issues be resolved simultaneously, even if this means postponing the process for a week or two. Following failure of the talks, the DS, which won 37 parliamentary seats, said it would not support a minority government of the other three parties. 
 But both the new Croatian government and its predecessor have repeatedly insisted that he is not in the country, making capture and transfer to The Hague impossible. In an interview with Croatian television on Friday, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte also pledged to back Zagreb's EU bid. 
 The first and basic authorisation is that we have the right to stop vehicles carrying customs goods anywhere [in Serbia]. 
 By creating new jobs, they have increased property values, while contributing to the country's GDP.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 05/02/04 Though the Olympics are just 17 days long, they are proving to be hugely beneficial, especially to the city of Athens. 
 The effects, both direct and indirect, are being felt in sectors and industries that have traditionally been the Achilles' heel of the Greek economy. According to the Centre of Planning and Economic Research, between 2000 and 2009 the Olympics will have boosted the economy by approximately 9 billion euros, through newly created jobs and upgraded infrastructure. 
 The large-scale co-operation by the armed forces and police is of major importance, as it will affect crime suppression through computerised intelligence and more trained personnel. The health system is also being improved for the Games. 
  Washington Urges Kosovo to Focus on Standards  06/02/2004 Senior US State Department officials have told Kosovo's prime minister that the province's leadership should focus on achieving internationally endorsed democratic standards rather than Kosovo's future status.  (VOA, The Washington Times, RFE/RL, Radio B92 - 05/02/04)Kosovo should focus on achieving UN approved standards, particularly those involving multi-ethnicity, rather than on the issue of the province's future status, US officials have told Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi. Rexhepi arrived in Washington to attend Thursday's (5 February) annual National Prayer Breakfast. 
 The international community has made it clear that it will decide whether the province is ready for talks on its future status after a review of the progress in the targets' implementation by mid-2005."We stressed the importance of implementing the internationally endorsed standards and co-operating with the UNMIK to achieve that goal," US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said during a press briefing Thursday. He said Washington continues to support UNMIK's and Holkeri's efforts "to bring about a multiethnic, democratic society in Kosovo, as defined by UN Security Council Resolution 1244". 
  Greece, Turkey Seek Lower Defence Expenditures  09/02/2004 Greece and Turkey are looking forward to lowering defence spending, which could lead to a more stable region.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 09/02/04 Greece and Turkey have expressed their readiness to co-operate in the reduction of military spending. 
 Such cuts would facilitate progress in settling other disputes between Ankara and Athens, including Cyprus, as well as air and sea rights in the Aegean, Papandreou suggested. Officials from both countries said the proposal to reduce their respective military budgets would be discussed during a series of meetings this year. 
  Papandreou Elected Greek Socialist Party Leader  09/02/2004 A month before Greece's general elections, members and supporters of the ruling Socialist party (PASOK) have elected Foreign Minister George Papandreou as their new leader.  (The Guardian - 09/02/04; AP, Reuters, AFP, Time - 08/02/04; Athens News - 30/01/04)Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou replaced Prime Minister Costas Simitis on Sunday (8 February) as leader of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), after receiving the overwhelming backing of party members and supporters. 
 His father, Andreas Papandreou, founded PASOK in 1974 and led the party for about 22 years, serving three times as prime minister. 
 His grandfather, George Papandreou, was Greek prime minister in the 1960s. Simitis, who took over the party leadership from Andreas Papandreou in 1996, announced his resignation in early January in a step widely viewed as seeking to boost PASOK's chances ahead of the March vote. 
 He also noted that Washington is willing to legally prosecute -- in the United States -- anyone accused of war crimes or of violating the conventions of war. 
 The US Treasury has added their names and others to a blacklist of individuals obstructing the regional peace process.  (Reuters - 10/02/04; AP, AFP, Reuters, BBC, DPA, Dow Jones, Washington File, US Treasury, US Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina - 09/02/04)The international community's top envoy in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Paddy Ashdown, has blocked the bank accounts of ten individuals said to be helping Radovan Karadzic and other war crimes suspects evade justice."We are launching today the next phase in our combined operation to attack criminal networks that support and give sustenance to, either directly or indirectly, Radovan Karadzic and other indicted war criminals in BiH," Ashdown said Monday (9 February) in Sarajevo. 
 The decision blocks the US assets of the 13 individuals, prohibits financial transactions by them with US citizens, and bars them from travelling to the United States. Washington has already blacklisted more than 160 people from the Balkans. 
 No other details have been released, as all parties agreed not to make public comments about the opening session. Meanwhile, about 3,000 Turkish Cypriots reportedly rallied in the divided city of Nicosia on Tuesday in support of an agreement. 
  Greece's Papandreou Must Gain Voter Confidence by March Elections  12/02/2004 George Papandreou, now PASOK leader, must gain the public's confidence for his party to be re-elected next month.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 12/02/04 Costas Simitis has held the post of Greek prime minister longer than anyone else -- he completed eight years in January. 
 His father, Andreas Papandreou, founded PASOK in 1974 and led the party for about 22 years, serving three times as prime minister. 
 Many Greeks feel that PASOK, which has governed the country for 19 of the past 22 years, has been in power too long and does not care about people's problems. As a result, the party's charismatic new leader has just weeks to regain voter confidence by election day. 
 He uses a laptop to take notes; he has a team of US-educated consultants; he updates his Web site daily; and is conscientious about fitness. 
 Steering clear of grandiose goals, he speaks of simple, bread-and-butter issues -- emulating the style of his father, two decades ago. In an interview with  Time  magazine, Papandreou said he was very proud of the PASOK government's achievements, while acknowledging that some issues had not been addressed with the same vigour as others. 
 The Macedonian Interior Ministry organised a campaign for his arrest in the village of Rakovce last June, but he managed to escape. 
 So are Gjuler Sulejmani and Izair "Baci" Samiu, who were involved in the violent takeover of the Tetovo Tabak building, which now houses Tetovo University. The list includes a former rector of Tetovo University, Fadil Sulejmani, and two ex-commanders of the "Lions", a special police force in Macedonia: Goran Stojkov and Goran Georgievski, also known as Mujo. 
 The only politician included on the blacklist is the vice chairman of the Tetovo branch of the Democratic Party of Albanians, Daut Rexhepi-Leka. On Tuesday, Washington added Xhezair Sakiri, Menduh Thaci and Jakupi-Cakala to its list of people banned from financial transactions with the United States. 
  Karadzic Living in Belgrade, UN Prosecutor Says  12/02/2004 Carla del Ponte, who has long insisted that Ratko Mladic is hiding in Belgrade, now says Radovan Karadzic has also found shelter in the Serbian capital.  (New York Times, The Guardian, Independent - 12/02/04; AP, AFP, Reuters, BBC, CNN, VOA, RFE/RL, Radio B92, Beta - 11/02/04)Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the most wanted war crimes indictee from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s, has taken refuge in Belgrade, according to chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte."I received just last week information from a credible source that even Karadzic is now in Belgrade," del Ponte told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday (11 February), after talks with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana. 
 Del Ponte has said that SFOR troops conducting an operation in the BiH town of Pale last month missed capturing Karadzic by two hours. Del Ponte's spokeswoman, Florence Hartmann, confirmed that information about Karadzic's move to Belgrade had come from "a very reliable source", and suggested that the raid in Pale had driven him to cross the border into Serbia."He moved out from BiH because the international community was searching for him very efficiently," Hartmann told CNN. 
  Ashdown Decision Attempts to Reunite Mostar  13/02/2004 The old town of Mostar, with its ethnically divided city administration, finally is united after a decision by international community High Representative Paddy Ashdown.  By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 13/02/04 The international community's High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Paddy Ashdown, imposed a decision unifying the administration in Mostar at the end of January. Instead of the six post-war municipalities -- three were held by political representatives of BiH Croats and three by BiH Muslims -- the Mostar administration will now be organised in one joint city council with six electoral units. 
 The ruling parties -- the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Democratic Action Party (SDA) -- failed to agree on unifying the city administration as required by the Dayton Peace Accords. 
 HDZ opposes the new electoral rules because the decision does not give Croats the same political majority they have in the population. Ashdown said that in case of obstruction, he would sanction not only city representatives of the SDA or HDZ, but also the party's top leadership."There is no perfect solution for Mostar, but this is the closest to the best solution," Ashdown told the local media. 
 And the real reunification of the city would be more realistic," Bise said. 
 Some guess that the Kalashnikov was in the rear of the car from which the sniper rifle was tossed, and someone merely wanted to get rid of an extra load. The sniper rifle, from which the serial number was also removed, could not be linked to the Special Operations Unit whose members are among those accused in the murder. 
 Neither does DNA from Davidoff cigarette butts that were found in the room from which the assassination was carried out. Due to some of the thermal ballistic findings, German experts have recommended a second reconstruction of the crime should be conducted. 
  Greece Prepared for Summer Olympics  16/02/2004 With official events starting in two months, preparations for the Summer Olympics are in the homestretch.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 16/02/04 On 25 March, the first Olympic event of the year will take place in Olympia, the sacred location of the Games in ancient Greece. 
 It will last for 78 days, as more than 3,600 torchbearers will carry it for 78,000 km. 
 The only project that remains outstanding is installation of the Olympic Stadium's glass and steel roof, designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. All road and transportation projects in Athens are scheduled for completion by 1 June. 
 The suburban rail, the tramlines and the extended Metro will act as the basis to move around the city without a vehicle. More than 26 sporting events will take place in the first two summer months, starting with a basketball tournament on 6 June. 
 The Olympic Games will end on 29 August, with an equally magnificent closing ceremony. Finally, Athens hosts the Paralympics in September, with more than 4,000 athletes from 125 countries taking part. 
  Former Rebels Arrested in Kosovo  17/02/2004 UNMIK police have arrested several former rebel fighters in connection with serious crimes, including the murder of fellow Kosovo Albanians.  (AP, Reuters, Radio B92, UNMIK, UN News Centre - 16/02/04)Several members of the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) have been arrested on charges of murdering fellow Kosovo Albanians during the 1998-1999 conflict in the province. The arrests were carried out early Monday (16 February) during a joint operation by UNMIK police and KFOR troops in Pristina and in the town of Prizren, about 80 km southwest of Kosovo's capital. 
 Musliu has denied all charges. On Monday, UN chief war crimes tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte said that Belgrade as well as unspecified members of the international community have not co-operated in the process of bringing ethnic Albanian war criminals to justice. 
 He has also been described as the principal organiser of the Ibar Highway homicides, although his name is not mentioned in the charges. The first assassination attempt against Djindjic on the highway in Belgrade, when a truck ran into a convoy of cars that drove the prime minister, is unmistakably reminiscent of the scenario played out in the 1999 murders. 
  Greece and Turkey Achieve Breakthrough on Cyprus Reunification  19/02/2004 The leaders of Cyprus met in New York and agreed to reach a definite solution by 1 May so that the divided island can enter the EU as a whole.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 19/02/04 Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, as well as representatives from Greece and Turkey, met at UN headquarters in New York last week, as requested by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
 It is a saddening thing that this has happened, but it does not scare us," said Talat, who is a proponent of reunification. 
 Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov says he will boycott an important party forum and may establish a new party.  (Novinite, Focus - 19/02/04; BBC, BNN, Mediapool, Dnevnik, Vseki Den - 18/02/04)Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov has announced his decision to boycott a major conference of the right-wing Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and possibly set up a new party by the end of February, depending on the outcome of the forum."Unless a miracle happens, I'll leave the UDF," Kostov said Wednesday (18 February), addressing supporters in a packed 1,500-seat hall at one of Sofia's universities. 
 A staunch anti-communist, Kostov has been voicing opposition to the present leadership's more moderate policies, its readiness to seek allies with former members of a UDF-led coalition, and what he describes as its failure to offer adequate political solutions to pressing problems. Mihaylova ran for Sofia mayor in the 26 October local elections and lost. 
 This, first of all, renders it difficult for the terrorist organisation to establish itself and carry out activities -- ranging from propaganda to revenue generation -- on US territory. 
 It is assessed that these attacks were carried out by a group with international connections and formed along the Selefi-Wahabi Line. 
 Later, Stambolic criticised Milosevic's policies during the Balkan wars in the 1990s. The former Yugoslav leader has denied any involvement in the murder, claiming last August he had no reason to seek the death of someone he did not consider a threat to his political career. 
 I think that was one of the motives why Milosevic gave the order to kill Mr Stambolic," Barovic said. Milorad "Legija" Lukovic -- the suspected mastermind of Djindjic's assassination -- has been charged with orchestrating Stambolic's abduction and killing, thought to have been carried out by members of a now-disbanded special police unit created during the Milosevic regime. Lukovic remains on the run and will be tried in absentia. 
  Serbia Urged to Co-operate with UN War Crimes Tribunal  24/02/2004 US and European officials have cautioned that Serbia's relationship with the international community, as well as access to financial aid, depends on continued reforms and on full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.  (AP, Reuters, EU, Washington File, Radio B92 - 23/02/04; AP, Reuters, VOA - 21/02/04; AFP - 20/02/04)Serbia was warned Monday (23 February) that its future relations with the EU and the United States hinge on the new government's commitment to reform and progress in other areas, notably full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).Vojislav Kostunica, the conservative leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), announced Friday that he would form a minority government with liberals and monarchists, one which he said would have an unquestionable "European determination". 
 The ICTY has been urging Belgrade to hand over about 15 war criminals believed to be in Serbia, including wartime Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic."Compliance with The Hague is absolute," a Brussels official said, adding that the EU would judge the new government by its deeds. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana has voiced concern over the prospects of a government formed with the support of Milosevic's party, predicting it would face "a lot of difficulties" in its political and economic relations with the international community."We are concerned and we will carefully monitor developments," Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted Solana as saying at a press conference. 
 Washington has made it clear that to have access to US aid worth $100m this year and other support from international financial organisations, Serbia must hand over wanted war criminals to The Hague. 
 "That includes co-operation with the tribunal," he said, adding that Washington wants to see Serbia succeed."We want to see Serbia integrate in the Euro-Atlantic structures and be part of a Europe that's whole, free and at peace," Boucher said. 
 "The government of Romania must openly acknowledge that accession in 2007 is not a done deal," Nicholson said. The 626-seat European Parliament is expected to vote on the report in early March. 
 The statement comes days after the chief UN war crimes prosecutor claimed Karadzic had moved to Belgrade.  (FENA - 25/02/05; AFP, FENA, AP, Reuters, CNN - 24/02/04)The European Commission's (EC) envoy to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) said Tuesday (24 February) that top Bosnian Serb war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were crossing the border with Serbia-Montenegro."My understanding is they can move back and forward across the border and I am afraid there is no doubt that they do," AFP quoted Ambassador Michael Humphreys as saying. His statement came less than two weeks after the UN's chief war crimes prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, claimed Karadzic had fled to Belgrade, in light of SFOR's stepped up efforts to capture him. 
  Serbia Destroys Strela 2 Rockets  26/02/2004 The destruction of anti-aircraft rockets signals the beginning of a new era of military co-operation in the fight against terrorism.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 26/02/04 Earlier this month at the military compound in Nikinci, a small village near Belgrade, 1,200 Strela anti-aircraft rockets were destroyed. 
 The agreement on destroying these rockets, which was financially supported by the US Embassy in Belgrade, indicates a willingness on the part of the Serbia-Montenegro Army to strengthen relations with Washington and the US Army. The US government paid the $800,000 cost of destroying a contingent of small and light weapons, ammunition and Strela rockets. 
 Bosnian police said they located the wreckage of his twin-engine turboprop near the village of Bitonja."At about nine o'clock this morning the radar lost control of an aircraft," said Zoran Glusac, a spokesman for the Bosnian Serb Interior Ministry. 
 "Local police said a blast was heard in the mountainous region between the southwestern town of Stolac and the village of Ljubinje. 
 "I do hope that some positive outcome can be reached ... to the benefit of the people in Kosovo and Serbia," he said. The focus of the talks would be practical issues in the province, such as infrastructure and electricity. 
 I therefore think Croatia should not bear any consequences on this situation."The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Carla del Ponte, has insisted that Gotovina is hiding in Croatia. 
 The German daily   Die Welt   published a public research survey showing that 56 per cent of the population were against Turkey's membership to the EU, while 40 per cent supported it. 
  Olympics Chief Urges Greeks to Focus on Essential Projects  01/03/2004 International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge has urged the organisers of the Athens Olympics to focus on completing essential projects, saying he is confident in the success of the games if the Greeks work at a very fast pace.  (Reuters, AFP, FT, Bloomberg - 29/02/04; AP, BBC, VOA - 28/02/04)International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge has urged the organisers of the 2004 Athens Olympics to focus on essential projects and work at top speed, as there is no room for delays. 
 Five and a half months before the opening ceremony of the Olympics begins on 13 August, the IOC chief believes there is time to make the Games a success."Very much has been achieved, much remains to be done," Rogge said Saturday (28 February), after a two-day IOC executive board meeting in Athens. 
 "If we have the stadium without the roof, but still functioning well, I am perfectly happy," he added, urging the organisers to concentrate on the "vital" projects and put aside the nonessential ones. The projects causing the biggest concern include a 30km suburban railway linking Athens' new airport with sports venues, and a tramline, running several weeks behind schedule. 
 Both projects are considered critical given heavy traffic problems in the Greek capital, where more than one million visitors are expected to arrive in August."It will take a great effort to get these things done," said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the head of the 2004 Athens Olympics Organising Committee. 
 Due to bad weather, potentially mined terrain and possible co-ordination problems, it was nearly 24 hours before search and rescue teams reached the crash site.  By Antonio Prlenda in Sarajevo and Marija Lazarova in Skopje for Southeast European Times- 01/03/04 For the past three days, Macedonian citizens stood in line to write down their final messages in the mourning book that was opened at parliament on Friday (27 February) in tribute to the late President Boris Trajkovski. 
 Foreign delegations will pay tribute and lay wreaths on the catafalque on the day of the funeral, in the order of their arrival to the country. Representatives of the VMRO-DPMNE party and of foreign countries, as well as Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and a representative of the Methodist Evangelist Church, to which Trajkovski belonged, will make speeches during the funeral ceremony. An initial investigation into the crash that killed Trajkovski and his eight assistants 20km south of Mostar on 26 February, indicated a possible co-ordination problem between local Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) authorities and SFOR, which operates air traffic control in BiH's airspace. Crvenkovski, who visited the crash site on Sunday, said that top SFOR officials have confirmed to him that "there were mistakes and contradictory information with public relations during the initial search and rescue operation".However, SFOR spokesman Dave Sullivan on Sunday explicitly denied allegations that SFOR admitted mistakes in communication. 
 Sullivan added that after the accident, SFOR was only present to provide support for helicopters and peacekeepers. According to the BiH Directorate for Civil Aviation (BH DCA) and SFOR, the crash site was found by rescuers near the village of Rotimlje. 
 Due to bad weather, terrain and possible bad co-ordination among search and rescue teams, the site was reached 24 hours after the accident."The two 'black boxes' with voice recorder and flight instrument data have been found and our international investigation team is analysing them," said Dzemal Hasecic from the BH DCA. 
 He has received the backing of former EC President Jacques DeLores.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 02/03/04 President of the European Commission (EC) Romano Prodi is to finish his tenure in October, after which, rumour has it, he will be involved again on the Italian political scene. The appointment of Prodi's successor has sparked a lot of interest, especially after former EC President Jacques DeLores announced that he sees Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis among the top three candidates to take up the tenure for the next five years. The other two prominent candidates are Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and former Belgian Prime Minister Jean Luc Dehaene. 
 You have cash and you buy valuable things such as apartments or cars which you can later sell easily," Taseva said. The amendments to the current law would tighten the measures of control over payments in exchange offices and casinos, where money turnover rate is very high. 
 One cannot register exchange of chips, but can take information from the players upon their entering the casino," Taseva said. A proposal by the economy ministry to require every shop to install at least two credit card readers is also aimed at reducing cash payments."Out of [about 3.7 billion euros] -- the annual money flow -- more than [1.6 billion euros] goes to cash payments. 
 The rest includes payments by current accounts, giro-accounts and other non-cash payments, with credit cards being used at very low levels," Economy Minister Stevce Jakimovski says. 
 He explains that the ministry is considering a measure where credit card payment commissions will not be borne by vendors, since that is the main reason for their refusal of non-cash payments. 
 Pressing also for early elections by the end of this year, opposition parties promised the protests would continue. Denying the allegations against him, Nano has refused to step down. With about 80 per cent of Albania's population of 3.1 million said to be living on less than $3 a day, public discontent has grown recently over the government's plans to increase bread, power, telephone and water prices. The 21 February protest was organised in defiance of a ban on public demonstrations, but police made no moves to disperse the crowds and the rally ended peacefully. 
 The project is also working to strengthen civil society and local government and to rebuild roads, electricity networks and water works. Though refugee returns -- as of October 2003 about 3,200 Muslims had returned to the three municipalities -- represent but a trickle of the pre-war Muslim population, UNDP reckons that the figures will only increase. 
 UNDP officials said the project highlights their commitment to the region in the aftermath of the tragedy."That was the major, fundamental, cardinal reason why UNDP decided to go ahead with the project," said UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Moises Venancio. 
 Of 109,808 registered voters, 1.64 per cent voted in the district council elections; 1.56 per cent of 33,497 registered voters voted in the city council elections. 
 The two top diplomats were among about 200 people attending a memorial service at the British consulate in Istanbul for the victims of the 20 November bombing attacks in the city. The suicide attacks on the British consulate and the offices of the London-based HSBC bank came five days after similar attacks on two synagogues in the city. 
 He added that a banking loan insurance foundation will be established to stimulate economic growth. On Thursday, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters that Washington is ready to work with the new government in Belgrade, but added US support hinges on progress in reforms, the rule of law, and co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
 He confirmed that Secretary of State Colin Powell had called Prime Minister Kostunica to tell him that continued aid from Washington would depend on the annual certification before Congress of Belgrade's co-operation with the UN court. 
 The polls give New Democracy the edge, but PASOK's leadership says that is about to change.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 05/03/04 In two days, 9.8 million voters are eligible to go to the polls to elect Greece's new leader. 
 They appeared realistic and down-to-earth, compared to Papandreou and Karamanlis who made big claims concerning job creation and the reallocation of government funds. ND and PASOK are the only parties that have been elected to government since 1974, leaving very few seats in parliament for others. 
 The move signals that well-managed, private sector companies in Albania can obtain long-term financing from the international market.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 08/03/04 Albanian private sector companies have received a strong positive message from key international financial institutions, which are encouraging the country to strengthen its position according to market economy principles. The EBRD, the IFC and Greece's Alfa Bank disbursed 85m euros last month to the mobile telephone company Vodafone Albania. 
 The state-owned telephone company Albtelecom has announced that it too will soon start mobile service. 
  New Democracy Triumphs in Greek Elections  08/03/2004 The conservative New Democracy party won a landslide victory in Greece's general elections, beating the incumbent PASOK by nearly 5 percentage points.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 08/03/04 The Greek conservative New Democracy (ND) party won a landslide victory in general elections on Sunday (7 March), ending 11 years of rule by the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). 
 With 97 per cent of votes counted, the party was headed for 165 seats in the 300-member parliament and 45.5 per cent of the vote. 
 PASOK will be allocated 117 seats; the Communist Party will receive 12 seats, while the Coalition of the Left (Synaspismos) will have 6 MPs. 
 Before making his victory speech, he met with Athens Olympics chief organiser Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, herself a former lawmaker from his party. Later, he told a cheering crowd that his top priority is to make the upcoming Summer Olympics the best and safest Games ever held. 
 She added that the indictments would be made public shortly and praised authorities for keeping them sealed since their delivery about ten days ago. Hartmann also said she expects the newly indicted generals to appear before The Hague tribunal soon and for Zagreb to take the needed steps in Gotovina's case. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) sometimes issues sealed indictments to give authorities time to prepare for the arrest and handover of the suspects. Markac and Cermak are expected to make a public statement Monday. 
 They have reportedly reached an agreement with Croatia's Council on Co-operation with the ICTY and could leave for The Hague as early as Wednesday, taking a regular flight aboard Croatia's national carrier with their lawyers. 
 They must bring their ID cards or passports to prove their identity and voting status. If 150,000 signatures are collected, parliament will be obligated to organise a referendum on maintaining the current municipal borders. 
  Turkey's Uzan Dynasty Collapses  11/03/2004 The Turkish government has seized more than 200 Uzan family-owned businesses in an attempt to collect debts to the tune of nearly 4.7 billion euros.  By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 11/03/04 More than 200 companies owned by Turkey's controversial Uzan family have been seized by the government, in what authorities say is an attempt to collect debts totaling billions of euros. The seized companies include the Star Media Group, cement factories and Turkey's second largest mobile telephone network, Telsim. 
 Uzan's party made important gains in the last election held in November 2002, but failed to pass the 10 per cent threshold required to win seats in parliament. Answering those accusations, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that his party promised to fight corruption and the relevant ministries are working to keep that promise. 
 Previous peace award winners include Indira Gandhi, Javier Perez de Cuellar, Pope Paul VI and Jimmy Carter. IAEWP representative Robert Tarfa said Djukanovic was selected for his courageous, democratic and peaceful resistance to former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's dictatorship, which Tarfa described as a threat to the entire region. Upon receiving the awards, Djukanovic said that he shared them with all Montenegrin citizens. 
  Athens Urges Cypriots to Follow UN Plan  11/03/2004 The new Greek government led by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has said resolving the Cyprus issue will be its top priority. 
 At the same time, he said the European Commission is preparing for an eventual outcome that would bring the Turkish-run part of Cyprus into the Union, along with the Greek part."I call on the two communities to seize this quite unique opportunity to show that they are ready for peace and reconciliation in this region," Verheugen said in Strasbourg as he addressed the European Parliament. Cautioning that the parties face an increasingly tight timetable, Verheugen said it was "a bit late but Mr Denktash is responsible for this delay".Annan's special envoy, Alvaro de Soto, is in Athens on Thursday to discuss the Cyprus issue with the new government. 
  Greece Steps up Security Following Madrid Blasts  12/03/2004 Greece, the host of the upcoming Summer Olympics, has stepped up security measures on all rail and subway networks and at the Spanish Embassy in Athens following terrorist attacks in Madrid.  (IHT, Independent, The Scotsman - 12/03/04; AP, Reuters, Athens News Agency - 11/03/04)Hours after Thursday's (11 March) bombings in Madrid, Greece said it is stepping up security measures throughout its rail and subway systems, as well as at the Spanish Embassy in Athens. 
 Security had already been heightened in the Greek capital, which will host the Summer Olympics in August."The transport and public works ministry is increasing security measures with immediate effect until further notice on all the country's railway and metro networks following the bomb attack in Madrid," a ministry spokesman said Thursday. According to the Athens News Agency (ANA), the measures include increased patrols at train stations and tunnels, which are already monitored around the clock via a closed circuit TV system. 
 The government has said it would announce proposed solutions to all remaining Olympics-related problems after Karamanlis meets with International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, who is due in Athens on Saturday. ANA reports the Madrid bombings, which claimed the lives of nearly 200 people from 11 countries and injured over 1,400 others, were also discussed at a meeting of Greek military chiefs involved in Olympic security planning. 
 The programme is intended to prevent the disease and to care for those who are infected.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 15/03/04 Albania has prepared a six-year national strategy aimed at fighting HIV and AIDS. 
 The WHO reports that the prevalence of this disease in Albania is less that 1 in 1,000, which is considered a very low level. According to the programme co-ordinators, the emphasis will be on disease prevention and treatment of infected persons. 
 The latter issue is crucial because of the high cost of medication."We know that together with caring for the infected persons, we have to concentrate on preventing the disease," says project co-ordinator Erjon Dasho, adding that this will be realised through campaigns in schools and the media. 
 More than 82 per cent of people infected with HIV are unemployed, 65.7 per cent are emigrants, and 65 per cent have had no formal education. A report launched by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and UNICEF in 2003 found that the disease especially threatens the mobile population. 
 Other groups at high risk include young people living without parental care, ethnic minorities, drug users and homosexuals. 
 Large portions of arable land, however, remained uncultivated as villagers turned to subsistence farming. The transformation process had a severe impact on the rose-growing industry. 
 According to Basri Rruka, president of the Association of Legal Car Dealers, the "massive trafficking of cars" is destroying automobile companies operating in the Albanian market. Albanian companies with exclusive distributor rights from foreign automobile manufacturers have urged the authorities to do more to combat the problem. 
 They also are demanding more control on importing cars. Rules followed throughout the world should be enforced in Albania as well, Rruka says. 
 "This process means that every car imported has to be controlled in order to check if it is imported in the framework of Albanian taxation legislation," he says. Under the process, authorities would not issue license plates for imported cars until the documentation has been sent to companies that have distribution rights for foreign cars in the country. 
 The companies, representing foreign car producers, would then verify the documents. Following these procedures would help assess if a plate can legally be issued for the car, Rruka believes. Albanian authorities have promised "zero-tolerance" in the fight against illegal trafficking and smuggling. 
 Many of the accession states represent important destinations or transit countries for many of the cars stolen in the EU, according to the report."Germany is often cited as a major source of stolen vehicles, while the Nordic countries, Baltic States and Poland are seen as important transit countries. 
  Serbian Media Faces Privatisation, Salary Issues  16/03/2004 The process of privatising Serbian media has been slow, according to an organisation dedicated to supporting independent media.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -16/03/04 An estimated 80 per cent of Serbian media companies have not begun the privatisation process, while one-fifth of them are not even considering it, according to research conducted last month by the IREX Promedia organisation. The organisation, which aims to promote and support independent media, also found that many of the country's media firms are barely surviving. 
 According to the Privatisation Agency's Dragan Bosiljcic, however, this will be difficult to do in the future."The law cannot protect everything, but the state can do quite a bit to protect media companies, even though legal loopholes exist -- in this respect we have to remain realistic," Bosiljcic says. IREX Promedia's research shows that there is significant influence by owners of media companies on their editorial policy, although the influence of politicians has diminished. Meanwhile, a survey by the Strategic Marketing Agency found that  Vecernje Novosti  is the most widely read newspaper in the country, while the magazine with the greatest number of readers is  Lisa . 
 "Under the 7th review, there won't be increases in the prices of natural gas, electricity and liquefied natural gas."Moghadam said that Turkey's recent success in the area of privatisation and the private sector's increased role in the national economy were promising factors. 
  Greek Carrier's Restructuring Under EU Investigation  17/03/2004 Suspicions about illegal state aid have led the EU to open an investigation into the restructuring of Olympic Airways. 
 Greece has been warned that its carrier may face liquidation if EU laws are not strictly observed in the company's privatisation.  (IHT - 17/03/04; European Commission, Reuters, AFP, EUpolitix - 16/03/04; BBC - 05/09/03; Reuters - 30/08/03)The European Commission (EC) has opened a probe into the restructuring and privatisation of Olympic Airways and has warned Greece that its national carrier may face liquidation unless the relevant EU laws are strictly observed in the process."The Commission decided today to initiate a formal state aid investigation procedure against Greece concerning Olympic Airways," the EC said in a statement Tuesday (16 March), citing "doubts about the arrangements for setting up and privatising a new company to be known as Olympic Airlines". 
 The probe, it said, was meant to ensure that no state aid is involved in the process. In a bid to both save Olympic Airways from bankruptcy and create a new national carrier before the 2004 Athens Olympics, parliament last September approved the government's plans for the company's restructuring. 
 Around 1,850 of them moved to Olympic Airlines. According to a Reuters report last year, the government's plans were to sell at least 51 per cent of the new carrier and use the proceeds to cover the old airline's debt and early retirement costs. Once parliament approved the government's plan for Olympic Airways' restructuring and privatisation, the EC asked Athens for details to confirm the programme complied with European laws. The EC does not allow governments to provide aid to businesses that have no chance of ever standing on their own feet, but will agree to temporary assistance if there is a real chance that a business in difficulty can eventually become more competitive as a result. Announcing the probe Tuesday, the EC said it wanted to assess whether the advantages granted to Olympic Airways constitute new state aid. 
 Many, however, are suspected of links to terrorist organisations.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 18/03/04 The 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in New York launched a general discussion concerning the role of fundamentalist Islam around the world, with attention being drawn to the role played by Muslim charities. 
 While many of these charities have provided humanitarian assistance and relief to thousands of refugees in war torn areas in Africa, Asia and Europe, some have also funded terrorist activities. Several Muslim relief organisations are currently active in the Balkans, having established operations there after the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
 The threat of terrorism has led governments in the region to examine their activities, some of which have been outside the scope of relief efforts. For example, authorities found plans for chemical attacks and maps of Washington at the Sarajevo offices of the Saudi High Commission for Aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
 NATO is sending peacekeeping units from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Kosovo. After erupting in the divided city of Mitrovica, violence also rocked Pristina, the towns of Lipljan, Pec, Gnjilane and Gracanica, and other locations. 
 US KFOR troops, meanwhile, reportedly began evacuating people from a Serb neighbourhood in Pristina. Tensions began to escalate late Monday when a Serb teenager was wounded in a drive-by shooting in the village of Caglavica, near Pristina. 
  Greek, Turkish Prime Ministers to Join Cyprus Talks  19/03/2004 The prime ministers of Greece and Turkey have accepted UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's invitation to participate in the second phase of Cyprus peace talks, to be held in Switzerland.  (AFP - 19/03/04; UN News Centre, AFP, AP, Swissinfo, Anadolu Agency, The Scotsman, Athens News Agency - 18/03/04)The prime ministers of Greece and Turkey, Costas Karamanlis and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, confirmed Thursday (18 March) their participation in the second phase of UN-sponsored talks to reunify Cyprus. 
 The final text would then be put to referendums in both parts of the island on 20 April. Discussing Cyprus with US President George W. Bush by phone Thursday, Karamanlis said any solution to the issue had to be viable, functional and compatible with EU standards, the Athens News Agency reported. 
 The prime minister is also said to have requested that Washington intervene to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to reach a solution within the EU framework."The Turkish Cypriot side may not get all its requests at the end of the process," said Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat, who will attend the talks in Switzerland. 
 We have been carrying out teamwork." 
  Serbian MP Investigated for National Bank Governor Election  22/03/2004 The annulment of former National Bank Governor Kori Udovicki's election has sparked an investigation into the alleged vote rigging by a Democratic Party member of parliament.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 22/03/04 State prosecutors have ordered an investigation into a Serbian member of parliament's alleged misuse of another member's electronic voting card. 
 The Democratic Party has been given a lesson which I hope it has learned," Udovicki said. Citing limitations in the Parliamentary House Rules, Parliament Speaker Dragan Marsicanin told MPs that he could not approve a request by Udovicki to attend the session of parliament at which the new governor would be elected, or permit her to address lawmakers. A request has been submitted to the Constitutional Court of Serbia (CCS) to assess the constitutionality of the article of the Parliamentary House Rules that stipulates a parliamentary vote can be annulled due to the misuse of voting cards."Since the decision [of the court] is a parliamentary act, the CCS is required to ask for a response from parliament regarding arguable issues. 
 "I am certain that the election process will confirm the democratic capacity and stability of the institutions of the political system," he added. Under amendments to the Law on Presidential Election that members of parliament approved in a shortened procedure, the candidates for the new head of state will have 14 days to campaign. 
 VMRO-DPMNE has announced that its candidate is Sasko Kedev, a cardiologist and parliament member. 
  Croatia Begins Campaign for NATO Acceptance  23/03/2004 The Croatian government has begun a campaign to inform its citizens about aspirations to join NATO.  By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 23/03/04 According to a poll conducted last month by the Centre for Market Research, 53 per cent of Croatians support the country's accession to NATO, while 28 per cent are against it and 18.6 per cent remain undecided. 
  Croatia and UNICEF Seek to Halt Violence Among Children  24/03/2004 Research indicates that as many as 20 per cent of children attending Croatian schools have been subjected to abuse by their peers. 
 Research has found that individuals who encounter violence and abuse as children have an increased risk of depression in adulthood. In Zagreb's schools, 17 per cent of children say that they were intentionally -- and on more than one occasion -- aggressive towards another child. 
 Because violence among girls has only recently been recognised and described, a longitudinal study has so far been carried out only on boys bullied by other children. 
 The purpose of the courts is to punish [citizens who] do not obey the laws, and the executive power is supposed to carry out all this," Speaker of the Vojvodina Parliament Nenad Canak said during the convention. The parliamentary session was held in the Novi Sad Assembly building after an anonymous warning that a bomb had been planted in the province's parliament building. 
 Canak said a police search turned up no explosive device. The day before the convention, parliament adopted a flag for the province. 
 The focus is on the immediate tasks of hosting the Summer Olympics and resolving the Cyprus problem.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25/03/04 After about 15 days in office, New Democracy (ND) ministers presented their four-year plan to parliament in a session that lasted three days. 
 In case of a snag in the timetable, alternative paths would be followed -- for example, Deputy Culture Minister Fani Palli-Petralia's move to cancel construction of a roof over the main swimming venue, due to delays. With the country now at an important crossroads both in terms of relations with Turkey and resolving the Cyprus issue, the new government has indicated it will follow the same foreign policy stance as its predecessor. Karamanlis also announced plans to reduce the length of military service to six months, rather than a year. 
 Karamanlis pledged to boost health care in Greece through the rapid creation of hospitals and medical centres around the country; patients would be allowed to select their own family doctor. Addressing the issue of public safety, Karamanlis said that police officers would now have to go through a University of Police Studies, rather than simply receiving academy-level training. The objectives were well received by the majority of parliament members. 
 Citing corruption and other problems, however, the European Parliament recently warned that the country's entry date could be delayed."We will not back off from or fail to carry out what we have promised in order to join the EU in 2007," Romanian President Ion Iliescu said Monday, addressing a seminar in Bucharest organised by  The Economist . 
  Kosovo Albanian Leaders Urged to Prevent Recurrence of Violence  26/03/2004 EU officials are urging the Kosovo Albanian leadership to ensure that recent acts of violence are not repeated, make a commitment to multiethnicity and rebuild Serb property destroyed during the clashes.  (Reuters, AP, AFP - 25/03/04)Kosovo Albanian leaders should make sure that there is no recurrence of interethnic violence in the province, EU leaders say in a draft statement expected to be released Friday (26 March)."The European Council called on all leaders, especially the Kosovo Albanian leadership, to take responsibility for the situation and to ensure such acts and threats of violence are not repeated," Reuters quoted the statement as reading. Western officials believe that the anti-Serb riots that broke out on 17 March, following the drowning of three Albanian boys in circumstances which are still being investigated, were organised by extremists among the province's ethnic Albanian majority. 
 "If some people think that with violence they can precipitate the decisions of the international community, they are wrong."According to Reuters, the EU statement also condemned the attacks against NATO and EU personnel, stressing that those responsible for the bloodshed last week must be brought to justice. More than 200 people reportedly have been arrested thus far in connection with the violence. The EU, the main banker for impoverished Kosovo, is also urging the provisional institutions to show commitment to the principles of multiethnicity."As an immediate step, they should allocate resources and take responsibility for urgent reconstruction of damaged property, including places of worship, to ensure the earliest possible return of internally displaced persons," the EU statement said. Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi reportedly has pledged to provide 5m euros for the reconstruction of Serb property damaged during the riots. 
 Put your money where your mouth is," UN Regional Administrator David Mitchel said Thursday as he toured the village of Svinjare, one of the seven Serb villages torched last week. 
 "We're aware that it increased the responsibility on our shoulders," he said, pledging to follow the path set by the country's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Voters selected approximately 90,000 local officials, including mayors, city and provincial councils from candidates representing 20 parties, along with village leaders who are not bound to political parties, in 81 provinces -- each of which is considered an electoral area. 
 Voters used four or five separate ballots: one for the mayor, one for the city council, one for the provincial council, one for the leader and, in some areas, one for the metropolitan city mayor. 
 The Alliance's biggest expansion in its 55-year history will be marked at ceremonies in Washington and in Brussels this week.  (IHT, AFX, Bloomberg, Rompres, BBC, Novinite - 29/03/04; AFP, DW, BTA, Mediapool, Dnevnik, Vseki Den - 28/03/04)Seven former communist states will join NATO this week as the Alliance moves to finalise its expansion into a 26-member bloc. 
 NATO's biggest enlargement in its 55-year history brings in countries from the Baltic to the Adriatic and Black seas. The prime ministers of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia are meeting in Washington Monday (29 March) to hand in their countries' accession protocols to US Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
  Greece Intensifies Efforts to Finish Olympic Projects  30/03/2004 Following a progress review and a number of key decisions, top IOC inspector Denis Oswald says Greece is on track to complete Olympic construction projects on time, though deadlines remain very tight.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 30/03/04 The International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s top inspector says Athens is on track to overcome delays and finish Olympic construction projects in time for the opening of the Summer Games in August."We have a clear picture of what is feasible, what is at risk," Denis Oswald said Friday (26 March) after meeting with key government ministers during a two-day inspection tour. 
 The review resulted in a number of key decisions, including cancellation of a long-delayed roof over the main swimming pool venue. In lieu of the roof, new sunshades will built to partially cover the pool area. 
 To guard against the blistering summer heat, expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius, some water sports events will be rescheduled for early morning and late afternoon. The change in plans has come under criticism from the International Swimming Federation, which called it a "total surprise", but Deputy Culture Minister Fani Palli-Petralia said the government had no choice. 
 Construction delays meant, "no alternative could be put into place and any emergency event or delay would have canceled the Olympic swimming sport from the Games," she said. Round-the-clock work is in progress at all the key sites, the minister said. 
 Further efforts are also needed in the areas of administrative capacity building and in the implementation and enforcement of legislation and reforms, as well as in achieving reconciliation in the region. 
  Agencies Bring Region-Based Approach to Building BiH Economy  01/04/2004 Five regional economic development centres are working in BiH to encourage entrepreneurs and to centre economic development on geographical regions, rather than on the two post-war entities.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 01/04/04 In Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) complicated business environment, even someone like Lejla Lacevic -- who invested her own money, built her salon in downtown Sarajevo and has a lawyer for a partner -- admits she needed help when she opened her own business. Lacevic, who moved back to Sarajevo two months ago from New York City, describes her newly opened LL Salon as a "gala". 
  Europe Boosts Co-operation in Fighting Terrorism  05/04/2004 A report from the EU police agency, Europol, studied the period between October 2002 and October 2003 and concluded that Europe faced a significant threat of terrorist attacks.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 05/04/04 As part of the fight against terrorist activities, European intelligence services have co-operated in uncovering the role of extremist groups within Europe. 
 Covering the year between October 2002 and October 2003, the report's conclusions were borne out by the 11 March explosions in Madrid. While the EU had not been a victim of Islamic extremist attacks within its boundaries during the period addressed by the report, it warned that "attacks overseas, notably in Morocco, were obviously targeting its citizens and interests. 
 The fact that no Islamic extremist attack has been committed in the EU [since October 2002] should not be considered as a diminution or an absence of threat."After the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, European intelligence services initiated co-operation in the area of counterterrorism. 
 Al-Qaeda has threatened Britain several times as a result of its close co-operation with Washington in the war against terrorism. 
 While failing to win a clear majority in the December 2003 early parliamentary elections, the SRS now holds the largest number of seats in the Serbian Parliament. Recognising the need for a single candidate to run against Nikolic, parties within the governing four-party coalition, led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), have indicated their readiness for compromise. 
 Establishing an effective asylum and migration management system is an important requirement of the Stabilisation and Association process with the EU.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 06/04/04 The European Commission (EC) and the UNHCR signed an agreement last month to assist Albanian authorities in dealing with asylum-seekers and migrants. Under the agreement, the EC will provide 2m euros to Albania within the framework of the CARDS 2003 programme. 
 The Netherlands has taken the welcome step of partnering with Albania within the framework of the Stability Pact Migration, Asylum, and Refugees Regional Initiative. Between February 2001 -- when the pilot programme was launched -- and December 2003, 601 foreigners, mainly from southeast Europe, Asia and the Middle East, have been pre-screened. 
 The other five include Bruno Stojic, defence minister of the "republic", retired Generals Slobodan Praljak and Milivoj Petkovic, who commanded the Herceg-Bosna armed forces, former military police commander Valentin Coric, and Berislav Pusic, who headed a prisoner exchange commission. A joint 26-count indictment ICTY chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte issued in March charged the six with crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva conventions and violations of the laws or customs of war. 
 Last week, Ashdown froze all state budget payments to the Serb Democratic Party, insisting that it continues to provide financial support to Karadzic."It would simply be irresponsible of me to allow a passage of public funds to a party that may continue to have financial complicity with indicted war criminals, including the founder, Radovan Karadzic," the AP quoted Ashdown as saying in Banja Luka. 
 Other areas of progress include the recent census, fair representation of minorities in civil service, and the use of minority languages in administration and on personal ID documents. The report welcomes recognition of the Tetovo University, while warning against overlapping educational institutions. 
 "Europe means jobs, a better living standard for all citizens, a chance for BiH to develop as a new European state and not to stay behind."The EU also has made clear that full co-operation with The Hague tribunal is a key condition for Balkan countries seeking to join its structures. In other news, UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte arrived on a surprise working visit to Sarajevo Tuesday. 
 The study detailed the results of in-depth interviews with 55 women who sought help from domestic violence telephone help lines and the shelter for abused women in Tirana. Many of these women, UNICEF found, went into marriage with high hopes and good intentions -- only to find themselves trapped in relationships with men who beat, kicked, raped and threatened them with guns and knives. Experts from WHO say that more must be done to address this widespread social problem. 
 If either side rejects the plan, only the Greek Cypriot part of the island will join the EU on 1 May.  (FT, Electronic Telegraph, DW, Athens News Agency - 08/04/04; AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC, CNN, VOA, FT, Anadolu Agency - 07/04/04)Rejecting the UN plan to reunite Cyprus, Greek Cypriot leader Tassos Papadopoulos and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Rauf Denktash, have urged their communities to vote against it in referenda on 24 April. The peace plan, proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, is aimed at ending the Mediterranean island's 30-year division so that Cyprus may join the EU on 1 May as one nation. 
 US Secretary of State Colin Powell telephoned his Greek and Turkish counterparts Wednesday to discuss ways to muster support for the plan, viewed by Washington as "fair".EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen says there is no other option. 
  New Greek Government Sets Priorities  12/04/2004 Greece's new government faces a number of critical foreign relations issues, among them EU enlargement, relations with Turkey, the Cyprus issue and the upcoming Olympics.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 09/04/04 The majority of deputies in parliament gave Greece's new government a vote of confidence on 5 April. 
 He has shown special interest in diplomatic issues during his political career. The government's two top priorities are preparations for the upcoming Summer Olympics and the Cyprus situation. 
 He has also voiced confidence that Macedonia would be invited to join NATO in 2006, with full-fledged membership in 2007.Kedev, 41, is a cardiologist and member of parliament, with experience working in Italy and the United States. 
 Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has already established ties with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 13/04/04 Greek-Turkish relations are high on the agenda of the new government in Greece. 
 Athens is aware of a possible deadlock in the talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots with regard to the UN peace plan, and the Greek government would like to see the Cyprus issue separated from Greek-Turkish relations. 
 Neither side wants a diplomatic setback. The main issues that concern the two countries are the continental shelf and Turkish claims in the Aegean Sea. 
 In Washington, Nano met with President George W. Bush, who assured him of US support for Albania's integration into NATO.Nano also met with the Secretary of State Colin Powell, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and members of Congress. 
  Athens Olympics Begin in Four Months  13/04/2004 Athens is intensifying efforts to complete all projects before the start of the Summer Olympics on 13 August. 
 Officials have voiced confidence that everything will be ready on time.  (FT, The Age - 13/04/04; The Washington Post, Knight Ridder, AFP - 12/04/04; CBS - 11/04/04; AP - 10/04/04; BBC -- 29/03/04 - 08/04/04)After more than a century, the Olympics return to Greece, their country of origin, this summer. 
 Just four months before the 13 August opening ceremony in Athens, heavy construction continues in many parts of the city."We don't need words any longer. 
 But a warning by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2000 that the Games could be moved to another country spurred the country into action. Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyanni has voiced confidence that everything will be ready on time. 
 These include a railway from the airport to the northern suburbs, a tram line linking the capital's centre with seaside Olympic venues, and the main Olympic stadium. The stadium's 16,000-ton glass-and-steel dome, designed by internationally renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, still needs to be put in place. 
 That is almost triple the amount Australia spent on security during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. An army of 55,000 security agents is responsible for the safety of 15,000 athletes, 20,000 officials, 1.5 million spectators and 4 million residents of Athens and at five other cities hosting special events. 
 A day after the 11 March bombings in Madrid, Greece also requested NATO's help with Olympic security. Focusing on the construction and security aspects of the Games, officials say the job of beautifying Athens will be left for the last few weeks of preparations. 
 They plan to decorate landmark buildings with large photos of ancient Olympia and to erect 11,000 giant banners around the city. 
 However, there is still much to be done.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 15/04/04 Trafficking in human beings is a serious, ongoing problem in Southeast Europe -- one that undermines the social structures and stability of countries in the region. 
 Otherwise, only the Greek Cypriots will join the Union. About 40,000 Turkish Cypriots reportedly attended the rally on the northern side of the divided capital, chanting "yes to the referendum, yes for peace" and carrying banners reading "peace cannot be prevented in Cyprus", "yes for our children's future," and "we need a double yes for peace". 
  AMBO Oil Pipeline Construction to Begin  16/04/2004 Starting next year, the Albanian-Macedonian-Bulgarian Oil Pipeline Corporation will build a 900km-long pipeline from the Black Sea to the Adriatic Sea. 
 About 350km of it will pass through Macedonia, resulting in an annual profit of 16m euros to 24m euros.  By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 16/04/04 Construction of the long-awaited Albanian-Macedonian-Bulgarian Oil Pipeline Corporation (AMBO) trans-Balkan pipeline that will transport Caspian oil from the Black Sea to the Adriatic Sea through Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania will begin next year, according to AMBO President Ted Ferguson. 
 "Local construction firms, with the capacity for such major projects, will join the construction of the pipeline, and we are starting talks with them next month. 
 "One of the major investors is OPIC (the Overseas Private Investment Corporation), along with US Exim Bank, the EBRD and two private banks -- Citibank and CFS Boston Bank -- which will provide 576m euros. 
 This is especially important at a time when the United States and Europe want to become less reliant on oil from OPEC members, analysts say. The pipeline is expected to generate profits of 16m euros to 24m euros a year to Macedonia from the fees paid by companies for oil transport through the country. Ferguson said he would make every effort to ensure the pipeline operates at full capacity and returns the money invested as quickly as possible. 
 To meet costs, the pipeline must carry 450,000 barrels a day -- which is why other companies will be encouraged to use it. 
 "We will travel the whole world and do everything we can to get the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' recognised," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said. In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis issued a cautious endorsement of the plan. 
  Greek Commercial Fleet Largest in the World  19/04/2004 The Greek shipping industry accounts for 18.3 per cent of the world's capacity. 
 But is the country reaping the full benefits of its market position?  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 19/04/04 Today, ships under the Greek flag account for 18.3 per cent of the world capacity in dead weight tonnage (dwt), or approximately half of the EU's capacity. 
 Such projects are often done abroad because Greek shipyards are not as competitive as foreign ones. Not only is Greece in the lead as far as capacity and sales are concerned, but thanks to EU regulations, it is also making investments in safer cargo ships, establishing another first in the Quality Shipping initiative. 
 For example, during the ceremony in Washington last month to welcome new members of NATO, Sanader met with President George W. Bush. 
  UN Policemen Stripped of Immunity Over Kosovo Shooting Incident  20/04/2004 The UN has stripped four Jordanian police officers of their diplomatic immunity so that they can be interrogated about a shooting incident in Kosovo in which a fifth member of their unit opened fire on a group of international correctional officers.  (International Herald Tribune, Newsday - 20/04/04; UN, AP, AFP, Transitions Online - 19/04/04; UNMIK, Reuters- 18/04/04)Four Jordanian police officers serving with UNMIK were stripped of their diplomatic immunity Monday (19 April), allowing them to be interrogated about a shooting incident which left three dead and eleven wounded. The incident occurred at the detention centre in Mitrovica on Saturday afternoon, when a fifth Jordanian officer, identified as Sergeant Major Ahmed Mustafa Ibrahim Ali, opened fire on a group of correctional officers -- including 21 Americans, two Turks and one Austrian -- as they were leaving the centre in three UN cars after a routine day of training. 
 At the same time, the report urged further efforts in minority rights, refugee returns, judiciary reform, regional co-operation and the fight against corruptionPatten said it is not surprising that Croatia is the first of the western Balkan countries to reach this stage, as it is meeting all the necessary economic criteria required to become a candidate country. The EC noted that the positive avis was based on an assessment by chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who said Croatia was now fully co-operating with the tribunal. 
 Albania and Macedonia have also said they would not withdraw their contingents."Bulgarian troops will remain in Iraq after Spain and Honduras ordered their soldiers home," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy told Powell in a telephone conversation Tuesday (20 April). 
 Another five soldiers were injured while fighting Shiite militias in Karbala earlier this month. Romania, whose contribution includes 700 soldiers plus 149 mine clearing specialists, military police and special intelligence officers under US command, has also reassured Washington of its continued commitment to the effort in Iraq."Romania will not withdraw its troops because a premature withdrawal could throw Iraq into chaos," the AP quoted Romanian President Ion Iliescu's spokeswoman, Corina Cretu, as saying. 
 Foreign Minister Mircea Geoanna had separate telephone conversations with Powell and US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice on Monday. Two other countries in the region -- Albania and Macedonia -- have also said they are not planning to pull out their troops out of Iraq. 
  Djindjic Murder Trial Resumes in Belgrade  22/04/2004 The head of Zoran Djindjic's security detail gave testimony in the trial of his suspected assassins, telling the Belgrade Special Court that police knew that a plot was in the works well before the attack was carried out.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 22/04/04 The trial of the suspected assassins of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic has resumed at the Special Court in Belgrade. 
 One of the major developments so far has been the testimony of the head of Djindjic's security detail, Milan Veruovic, who told the court Tuesday (20 April) that Serbian police knew of a plan to kill the prime minister well before the attack was carried out. Veruovic, who was wounded in the shooting, indirectly accused former senior police officials of failing to properly boost measures to protect Djindjic, even after an earlier attempt on his life. Prosecutors have charged Zvezdan Jovanovic, deputy commander of a special operations unit at the time, with the actual shooting. 
 The material evidence found at the scene of the crime, in front of the Serbian government and the location from where shots were fired, indicates that only one gunman is at issue," Milic said. The lawyer for the Djindjic family, Rajko Danilovic, said a brand new investigation is unnecessary because of "all the facts that indicate who organised and carried out the assassination". 
 Danilovic said it is still not known who commissioned the murder and that that any further investigative efforts should be directed towards that question, rather than starting from scratch."It is known that the Zemun Clan, amplified by the criminally inclined wing of the Red Berets, could not carry out the murder of Djindjic, had they not enjoyed the support of certain powerful politicians. 
  Pressure Grows as Cyprus Reunification Vote Nears  22/04/2004 With the date for twin referenda on the UN peace plan for Cyprus rapidly approaching, international attention is focused on the outcome.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 22/04/04 UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told Cypriots in a televised address on Wednesday (21 April) that the UN-sponsored plan for reuniting the island is the only foreseeable route to peace. 
  Weekend Referenda Viewed as Turning Point for Cyprus  23/04/2004 Whatever the outcome, Saturday's referendum in Cyprus will have a major effect on the island, Turkey, Greece and international politics.  By Mustafa Azizoglu for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 23/04/04 Described by strategists as "a carrier that never sinks" in the Mediterranean, Cyprus will experience its most critical day in 30 years on Saturday (24 April). 
 A poll by the Centre of Public Research and Education Consultancy in northern Cyprus found that 62 per cent of Turkish Cypriots favour the plan. 
 "What we witnessed in Kosovo was not just one-sided, careless and unprofessional journalism in a post-conflict volatile society, but it was a tragic lack of other balancing voices, at least in the broadcast media," he said. The OSCE paper sharply criticised reporting by the province's three main TV channels on the evening of 16 March, voicing particular concern over the performance of the sole public broadcaster, RTK (Radio and Television of Kosovo), the night before and after the riots broke out. Print media played a more constructive role, the paper said. 
 Tourism Minister Bozidar Kalmeta has expressed dissatisfaction with the level of preparations in some Croatian communities, resulting from work delays. At the same time, the government is addressing the problem of uncontrolled shoreline construction and encroachment on the seashore. 
 However, Nenadic adds the legislation suffers from a serious flaw: it does not allow property and income information to be disclosed to the public. State Administration Minister Zoran Loncar, who proposed the law, says the government is placing top priority on its adoption, which is why it is being pushed through in an accelerated procedure. 
 The law is cited in the coalition agreement signed between the Democratic Party of Serbia, G17 Plus and the Serbian Renewal Movement. Loncar confirmed that the information collected under the new law would not be accessible to the public. 
 "As a close friend of your country, I strongly encourage you to participate massively in the second round of the election," Solana said, adding that a failed vote would delay reforms and amount to a setback on Macedonia's path towards the EU and NATO.Similar statements have come recently from other Western officials, including US Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler and the head of the OSCE mission in Skopje, Ambassador Carlos Pais. However, some leading VMRO-DPMNE members, including former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski, have reportedly called on supporters to boycott Wednesday's vote. 
 That, in turn, was in response to an Athens-backed coup which sought to unite Cyprus with Greece. 
 Investigators have therefore concluded that the evidence did not support "a grounded suspicion of the commission of a criminal act".Criticising Kosovo media for irresponsible reporting, an OSCE report last week concluded that "reckless and sensationalist" coverage of the drownings had contributed to the escalation of violence."The media, specifically the broadcasting sector, displayed unacceptable levels of emotion, bias, carelessness, and falsely applied 'patriotic' zeal," the report said. More than 260 people reportedly have been arrested since the riots on charges ranging from arson to murder. In other news, KFOR spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jim Moran said Wednesday that peacekeepers had detained a former Kosovo Albanian rebel leader in connection with last month's riots. 
  International Commission to Report on Balkans  30/04/2004 A new international organisation is using the Carnegie Commission as a model to develop a vision for the integration of Balkan countries into the EU.  By Emil Tsenkov for Southeast European Times in Sofia - 30/04/04 On 15 April, the International Commission on the Balkans was launched in Brussels, supported by the King Baudouin Foundation in Belgium, the Marshall Fund in Germany and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation in the United States. Former Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato is chairman of the commission. 
 Its executive director, Ivan Krastev, is the head of the Sofia-based Centre for Liberal Strategies, which will become the commission's collective secretariat. Commission members include former German President Richard von Weizsacker; former Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov; former prime ministers Carl Bildt of Sweden and Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium; Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana of Romania; Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic of Serbia-Montenegro; and future Slovenian EU Commissioner Janez Potocnik. The objective of the commission is to develop a vision for the integration of the countries of Southeast Europe into the EU and other international structures. 
 The commission has developed special criteria to help it assess the current situation in the region. The report must be approved by two-thirds of the 18 commission members before it is presented to the European Commission in Brussels, to the governments in the region and to officials in Washington. This initiative is patterned after the famous Carnegie Commission, which reported on the Balkan situation at the beginning of the 20th century. 
  Prosecutors Seek to Remove Sofia Mayor From Office  30/04/2004 Prosecutors have charged Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski with abuse of office over a 1999 deal involving municipal property.  (News.bg - 30/04/04; BNN, Novinite, Dnevnik, Mediapool, Novinar, bTV - 29/04/04)Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski was charged Thursday (29 April) with abuse of office over a 1998-1999 deal involving municipal property. 
 Prosecutors ordered the mayor to pay a bail of approximately 5,000 euros or face arrest, and barred him from leaving the country. 
 They also called for Sofianski's removal from office. Prosecutors opened the corruption probe Monday following accusations by Sofia Regional Governor Rosen Vladimirov that the mayor had been selling municipal property at giveaway prices. 
 With the increase in the joint company's capital, however, the municipality's hold has dropped to 25 per cent of the shares. Last year, when the price of the joint venture's shares was estimated at about 674 euros per share, the mayor's office suggested that municipality sell its stock for a total price of about 840,000 euros, a move the municipal council rejected. Emerging from a 45-minute interview with prosecutors on Thursday, Sofianski said that five years ago, when the deal was struck, the mall shares were practically worthless as a result of mismanagement by the previous municipal authorities."I had been left a crumbling building and there was nobody to invest in Sofia at that time," Sofianski said. 
 Therefore, the mayor added, he decided to offer the store shares at their balance sheet value rather than at their market value, which was close to zero. 
 Sofianski did not order such an evaluation. The joint venture is now one of the best working businesses in Sofia, the mayor said Thursday."I will appeal the bail ruling," Sofianski said, adding that he was not planning to leave the country. It is the second time he has been charged with abuse of office. 
 The mayor denied the charges, claiming the investigation was politically motivated. 
 The riots cut the ski season short and generated losses."The economic situation has become very difficult," says Alexander Jenicevic, the manager of the Tourist Complex INEX. 
 "Because of the events of 17 and 18 March, virtually every activity has stopped in the middle of tourist season. 
 There are no security problems here," he said. Soon the snow will start to melt and the hotels will close until the next ski season. 
  Greece Steps up Olympic Security Measures  03/05/2004 Armed guards will be protecting British, Israeli and US athletes around-the-clock against potential terrorist attacks during the Athens Olympics, part of an overall tightening of security measures for the Games.  (The Guardian, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, The Australian - 03/05/04; BBC, Electronic Telegraph, UPI, Independent, AP - 02/05/04; AFP - 01/05/04)British, Israeli and US athletes will be provided with 24-hour armed protection against possible terrorist attacks during the Athens Olympics in August, Greek officials have confirmed."We are talking about armed guards for every official and non-official activity, including shopping and sightseeing," a spokesman for the Greek Ministry of Public Order said Sunday (2 May). 
 "The protection will cover all 'off-duty' trips outside the heavily fortified Olympic village, with athletes given the kind of security usually reserved for visiting heads of state," the official told the  Sunday Telegraph .Security planners have placed the 202 nations participating in this year's Olympics into three risk categories -- high, medium and low. 
 "It is out of the question," Voulgarakis told the British daily  Independent  on Sunday. He is in the United States this week for consultations in Washington and New York. 
 The trip precedes similar meetings in London and a conference in Athens later this month to be attended by key intelligence and security personnel from 40 countries. The security plan will be launched 1 July. 
 A no-fly zone will be enforced around Olympic venues and three separate wire fences will encompass the perimeter of the Olympic Village."Does this mean there is zero risk? 
 It's the latest in his series of colourful and controversial projects.  By Emil Tsenkov for Southeast European Times in Sofia - 04/05/04 After having wrapped the Pont Neuf in Paris, decorating 11 Florida islands, planting 1,760 yellow rainbows in California and 1,340 blue ones in Japan, and after having more recently transformed the Reichstag in Berlin into a futuristic white silhouette, the famous duo of Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude are ready to take on New York City next February. They plan to install 7,500 doors along the 23 miles of paths in Central Park. 
 This will be their first artistic project in New York City, which is where they live. 
 The following year, Christo went to Paris where he painted portraits and met Jeanne-Claude. As early as 1962, he had the idea of wrapping objects and arranging them in the city space. 
 In addition to his unusual projects, Christo continues to paint, earning between $200,000 and $500,000 per painting. The Bulgarian public is somewhat disappointed that during his long and successful career, Christo never returned to the country to wrap some of its important buildings. 
 He has been indicted for the murders Djindjic and former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic, as well as the attempted assassination of Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement."The investigation of Lukovic was carried out in absentia, the indictments took legal effect, and since he is now present, he will be questioned in two main hearings on the two indictments," Kovacevic said. 
 Some say he was drunk and that he yelled that he had murdered no one while being taken into the police car. Committee of Human Rights Attorneys President Biljana Kovacevic Vuco said she is concerned by the media speculation surrounding the surrender. 
 Attempts by police to arrest him have failed, according to the Macedonian daily  Utrinski Vesnik , and Boskovski is reported missing."Police are searching for him and have told all border patrols to be on the lookout for Boskovski," interior ministry spokeswoman Mirjana Kontevska said Tuesday. Acknowledging Friday that the seven victims of the March 2002 incident near Skopje were illegal immigrants and not "mujahideen terrorists", as Boskovski claimed at the time, authorities charged him with murder. 
  Greek Government to Crack Down on Corruption  06/05/2004 A new plan by the minister of internal affairs and public administration calls for harsh penalties and imprisonment of civil employees who violate the government's trust.   By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 05/06/04 In an unprecedented move against corruption, Greek Minister of Internal Affairs and Public Administration Prokopis Pavlopoulos has called for the severe punishment of any civil employee who abuses the government's trust. 
 The government's goal through this new bill is to crack down on corruption in the public service sector. In the first phase of the plan, the tax office will conduct computer-assisted investigations into public officials' assets. 
 The Financial Crime Prosecution Unit, which can demand to review the books of any business without advance notice, may uncover more irregularities than those it reports. With a health system in poor shape by EU standards, some doctors and surgeons in public hospitals are among those who enjoy the benefits of corruption; they ask patients for a fee to jump the queue and receive faster treatment. According to the European Central Bank, Greece has the highest level of corruption of any country in the EU. 
 Among the proposals is stopping the import of cars produced more than ten years ago, and removing custom duties on cleaner-running cars produced in the last two to five years. The government estimates there are more than 200,000 cars on the road now, a figure that is rising by about 10,000 annually. 
 Another problem for the environment is leaded petrol, used by 40,000 or so cars. Nearly 90 per cent of Albania's cars that are more than nine years old produce most of the pollution, authorities say. 
 More than 80 per cent of the cars are diesel-powered. 
 Poorly maintained diesel engines emit large quantities of microscopic particles, called PM10s, which can lodge deep in the lungs and are carcinogenic. The World Health Organisation limit for PM10s is 50 microgrammes per cubic metre of air, but at one central Tirana crossroads, the 24-hour average exposure was 483 micrograms, with peak-hour levels far higher. According to the reports, traffic-related pollution has also increased death rates in parts of the capital by 20 per cent in the last ten years. 
 The businessmen won with a 5.2m-euro bid -- beating out offers from an Italian and a Turkish company. This was seen as a sign that Albanian business is trying to be more active in investments by participating in important auctions. The EBRD, which disbursed 10m euros to the hotel's managing company DV-Alba, expressed satisfaction with the auction. Earlier this year, EBRD, the IFC and Greece's Alfa Bank disbursed 85m euros to mobile telephone company Vodafone Albania. 
  Turkey Launches Major Rail Tunnel Project  10/05/2004 Turkey has begun constructing a rail tunnel under the Bosphorus Strait, linking Istanbul's European and Asian sides. 
 The 2.1 billion-euro project, due to be completed in 2008, aims to reduce traffic congestion in Turkey's largest city.  (CNN - 10/05/04; AFP, BBC, Anadolu Agency - 09/05/04; Turkish Daily News - 08/05/04; Reuters - 07/05/04)Turkey has launched the construction of the first rail tunnel under the Bosphorus Strait, linking Istanbul's European and Asian sides. 
 Japanese construction company Taisei Corp announced Friday it won a Turkish government order for almost 790m euros. Seeking to allay fears about the possible impact of earthquakes on the facility, Turkish officials explain that being built into two metres of rock, the tunnel will be able to withstand a quake measuring up to nine on the Richter scale. Located between two huge tectonic plates, Eurasia and Africa/Arabialies, Turkey is susceptible to frequent powerful quakes. 
 Two earthquakes in Bingol in 1971 and in 2003 killed about 900 and 150 people respectively. The Bosphorus Strait is a 32km waterway linking the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara. 
 Running across Istanbul, it separates the city's European side from its Asian side, as it flows by ancient palaces, mosques, fortresses and parkland. To build the tunnel, Turkey is using loans from the Japan Bank of International Co-operation. 
 The entire project also will involve the refurbishing and upgrading of Istanbul's existing rail system. The tunnel, which will have the capacity to carry 150,000 passengers per hour in both directions, is expected to reduce traffic congestion. 
 It would become the third link between Istanbul's European and Asian sides, which is currently provided by two bridges -- the first, a 1,074m structure built in 1973 and the slightly shorter second one, erected in 1988.A third bridge appears under consideration, though Erdogan has previously voiced opposition to such plans, because of the possible damage it could cause to the environment."Istanbul is in need of a bridge and in time, will need another tunnel. 
 According to the ideas proposed by Minister of Education Dragan Primorac and his associates, students will no longer have to memorise historical dates, names, heights of mountains and other arguably superfluous information."It will no longer be required to memorise thousands of definitions and lists, and hundreds of university-level terms that fill up today's textbooks will be deleted. 
  Greece Says It Will Not Economise on Olympics Security  12/05/2004 The security budget for the Athens Olympics is already nearly double the initial estimates, a senior Greek official has said, announcing plans to boost the number of security personnel to protect athletes, officials and spectators during the Games.  (BBC - 12/05/04; Electronic Telegraph - 12/05/04; AP, AFP, Reuters, BBC, CNN - 11/05/04)Seeking to ensure the safety and success of the Athens Olympics, the Greek government has pledged not to economise on security. 
 Fears were heightened last week when three small bombs exploded outside an Athens police station, 100 days before the opening ceremony. 
 Surveillance cameras are being attached also to the 18,000-tonne glass-and-steel roof over the main Olympic stadium, which is expected to be fully in place in a few days. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which had previously given the organisers until 20 May to slide the dome's two huge arches into place or abandon the project, appeared confident Tuesday that all sports venues and key infrastructure projects would be completed in time for the opening ceremonies. Denis Oswald, the chief IOC overseer of the Athens Games, said Wednesday, "We had doubts about some of the venues and infrastructure, but I am very happy to report these have all disappeared. 
 Despite access to other international financial institutions and clearing houses, the company plans to get the largest investments from reinvesting the rental income profits. According to plans, 20 per cent of the overall capacity of Bunardzik will be constructed on a 300,000 square meter area for two to five years; 50 per cent will be constructed on 750,000 square meters within 10 years; and complete utilisation of 1.5 million square meters is expected within 20 years. The company says the car industry would be the main target sector in the first year the zone is established, followed by the air and cosmetic industries, as well as telecom antenna businesses. 
 He feels that tourists who come looking for mountains, villages that haven't changed in 100 years and winter sports will find BiH enchanting. He is also hoping that encouraging such small-scale adventure tourism would be good for BiH because it would foster the growth of small businesses -- pensions, restaurants, and tour companies -- that should make up the backbone of the country's economy. 
 Ashdown said that it's not too late to address these."It was only 25 years ago in Britain that we started to have the discussion as to whether or not our beauty spots should be littered with derelict cars," he said. 
  Serbia, World Bank Reach Agreement  17/05/2004 Serbia is expected to receive $120m by the end of the year under an agreement reached with the World Bank during a government delegation's visit to Washington. 
 During its visit to Washington, the delegation was told that economic stability must be accompanied by political stability. According to Labus, negotiations were held with a World Bank delegation headed by President James Wolfenson. 
 A three-year agreement worth $550m was reached as part of the Country Assistance Strategy Programme. While in Washington, Labus also spoke with Deputy US National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley, who said that the United States is ready for improved relations with Serbia. 
 No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, which caused minor damage and no injuries. Police sources said the first explosions occurred at around 10:30 pm local time in Istanbul, when two bombs went off in front of two HSBC branches on the same avenue in the Asian side of the city. Later, similar attacks targeted two offices of the British-owned bank in Ankara. 
 According to police, one of the bombs had been placed under a bank employee's car. 
 Security has reportedly been stepped up around the bank's offices in the capital. Reports said the devices used in the attacks were homemade percussion bombs, which produce a loud bang on detonation but have limited damage capacity. Sunday's attacks were not the first against HSBC's offices in Turkey. 
 Many of their interiors remain intact, with elaborately carved wooden ceilings, cupboards and screens, and frescoed walls and fireplaces. 
  Greece's Karamanlis Calls for Further UN Efforts to Reunite Cyprus  19/05/2004 Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis is calling for continued UN efforts to reunite Cyprus, so that both its communities can reap the benefits of EU membership.  (UN News Centre, AP, Reuters, Athens News Agency - 18/05/04; Kathimerini - 17/05/04)Calling for new diplomatic initiatives, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis told UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Tuesday (18 May) that efforts to reunite Cyprus should continue."I am not ready to accept the recent developments as a full stop, but only as one phase in the process," Karamanlis said at a press conference after the meeting. While agreeing that a solution to the Cyprus issue should be sought, Annan said there was a need "for the dust to settle", giving all parties involved in the process time to reflect. While 65 per cent of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of Annan's plan to reunite Cyprus in last month's referenda, the majority of the Greek Cypriots rejected it. 
 While in Washington, the prime minister will also hold talks with Vice President Dick Cheney and members of the House Committee on International Relations and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Besides Cyprus, discussions are expected to focus on security arrangements Greece is making for the Summer Olympics in Athens. In other news, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said Tuesday that the European Commission is planning to propose the establishment of direct trade between northern Cyprus and the EU. 
 Critics say that in this way the Serbian education system is moving further from European standards. Responding to accusations from Knezevic and others, Minister for Elementary and Secondary Education Vekeslav Janicijevic said the changes are necessary because of the difficulty in carrying out reforms."The previous ministry had very specific deadlines for adopting particular programmes according to the Law on the System of Elementary Education and Upbringing which have not been met. 
 He also blames the Sofia municipality and Mayor Stefan Sofiyanski for not waging an effective fight against the counterfeiters. 
 The Liberal Alliance has generated additional publicity for the case, particularly with a rally held on 4 May in Podgorica. The rally, dubbed "We Do Not Like Chains", was organised by leaders of the Liberal Party, the Socialist People's Party, the People's Party, the Serbian People's Party, and the Serbian Democratic Party. 
 Between 1998 and the start of this year, mines have been removed from 458 square km of Croatian territory. Recently, a mine removal exercise was conducted on the Gaj polygon, with special equipment and trained dogs assisting with the search and removal of the mines. 
 His diplomatic career spans nearly three decades and included posts in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Mexico, Denmark and Panama. 
 The two are also accused of murdering fellow ethnic Albanians during the 1998-1999 conflict in the province. Colonel Islam Gashi and his father were detained early Monday (24 May) during a raid in the Prizren region, about 80km southwest of Pristina. 
 Both he and his father are former members of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which fought against Serbian forces during the Kosovo war."Those detained are suspects in serious criminal offences such as murder," a UNMIK police statement read. 
 Their remains were unearthed in November 2001, during the excavation of a mass grave near Trebos, a village in the Tetovo area where human bones and remains were found. The Research Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Research Centre performed the analysis, together with the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Art and an institute in Tuzla linked to the Sarajevo-based International Commission on Missing Persons. 
 "An effort was made to get in touch with the family of two brothers who were missing during the conflict so that samples of their blood could be taken and DNA analysis made."The area near Trebos where the bodies and remains were found is still being searched, and additional tests are continuing."The data that comes from our centre is 99 per cent accurate and we are behind the results that helped identify the three people," said Geoffrey Binger, who heads the Macedonian office of the International Commission on Missing People. Mihail Levinski, the government-appointed co-ordinator in charge of the missing persons issue, said there was no room for doubt. 
 His trial is likely to take place in Croatia.  (AFP, Reuters, BBC, Croatian Information Centre, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Washington File - 25/05/04)The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has indicted retired Croatian General Mirko Norac for war crimes perpetrated against ethnic Serbs during his country's 1991-1995 war of independence. 
 He died last year. In Croatia's highest profile war crimes trial to date, the Rijeka County Court sentenced Norac to 12 years in prison in March 2003 after convicting him of organising and carrying out the execution of 50 Serb civilians in the town of Gospic in October 1991, when he was in charge of defending the town from Serb forces. 
  Passport-Free Entry into Turkish Cypriot North for EU Nationals  27/05/2004 EU nationals, including Greek Cypriots, now need only to show identity cards to enter northern Cyprus.  (AFP, BBC, Reuters, UPI, VOA, EUobserver, Washington File, International Herald Tribune, Kathimerini, Cyprus News Agency, Anadolu Agency, NTV MSNBC - 26/05/04)Turkish Cypriot authorities have eased entry conditions for EU nationals, including Greek Cypriots. 
 Instead of a passport, citizens of the 25-member bloc will now only need to show identity cards to cross into the Turkish Cypriot part of the Mediterranean island. The decision, which took effect Wednesday (26 May), is part of a package of recently adopted measures aimed at improving the economy, especially the tourist sector."We have reached a new stage in crossings," Turkish Cypriot Foreign Minister Serdar Denktash said Tuesday. 
 In the event Cyprus peace talks were resumed, the government would be the one to represent the Turkish Cypriots at the negotiating table, he said. Meanwhile, the US State Department suggested Wednesday that it now considers Turkish Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, and not Denktash."Secretary Powell has met with Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat in his capacity as leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, and US Ambassador to Cyprus Michael Klosson has called on Mr. Talat as leader of the Turkish Cypriot community," the State Department said in a written statement on Wednesday, in response to a question posed by reporters. 
 "Our position is that he is the leader of the Turkish Cypriots."According to the Greek daily  Kathimerini , Washington has decided to provide $50m in economic assistance to the Turkish Cypriots and to adopt measures to boost trade relations with the island's north and bolster its tourist sector. 
  Leaders from 17 European Countries Meet in Romania  28/05/2004 Attending a two-day summit, the presidents of 17 Central and Southeast European states emphasise the importance of EU enlargement, stressing its role in overcoming nationalism and disseminating democratic values.  By Ovidiu Barbulescu for Southeast European Times in Constantza -- 28/05/04 The presidents of Central and Southeast European states gathered at the Romanian Black Sea resort of Mamaia on Thursday (May 27) for a two-day meeting on the future of the EU. 
 Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who could not come because of health problems, sent a letter saying that "no political position or juridical stumbling block can slow or block" European integration. The heads of state agreed that European integration benefits both joining countries and older member states, and that it allows the EU to strengthen its economic and political influence at the international level. 
 With European integration forging new kinds of relationships between the European states involved in the process, the pool of attendees has gradually widened to include 17 states. It is the first time the Black Sea resort has hosted such a large gathering of political leaders, and tight security measures have been put in place by Romanian authorities. 
 At the same time, he called for further steps to address problems in the area of women's rights. Commenting on a move Wednesday to allow the state-run radio and television network to begin broadcasts in Kurdish, Kretschmer described it as another very important development towards meeting the EU membership criteria. Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivered the annual European Studies lecture at Oxford University on Thursday, summarising his country's potential contributions to the EU community. In an hour-long interview with the  Wall Street Journal  last week, Erdogan said a decision to open entry talks with Turkey was a "great opportunity for the EU and a step towards bringing peace and stability to the region". 
 Within the framework of the Common Action Plan, they have agreed to co-operate closely with Athens during this summer's Olympic Games. In its most recent report on Albania, the European Commission (EC) urged the country to take stronger steps against organised crime and corruption, as well as to improve the functioning of the judicial system. According to the report, Albania deserves credit for its generally constructive role in the region, and for the reduction of smuggling and trafficking in human beings across the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. 
 Five days later, truck bombs hit the headquarters of the London-based HSBC bank and the British consulate in the city. 
 Meanwhile, Socialist Party of Serbia candidate Ivica Dacic launched his presidential bid with a visit to the village of Mirosina, near Nis. One of Serbia's wealthiest citizens, Bogoljub Karic, is also in the race. 
 Currently, the figure is 52 per cent. Considering the reforms that have yet to be carried out, the president said, many companies are not capable of withstanding the pressures of competition that would come with membership in the Union. Reacting to Mesic's speech, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said that the go-ahead given by the EU should not be undermined, and that Croatia's international status has improved. The key for the economy is increased competitiveness, Sanader said. 
  Republika Srpska Promises to Detain Alleged War Criminals  01/06/2004 Pledging stronger efforts to arrest war crimes indictees, Bosnian Serb authorities say they will soon provide concrete results.  (Office of the High Representative - 01/06/04; Reuters, Fena - 31/05/04)Assuring UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte of their political will to co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Bosnian Serb authorities have promised to step up efforts to arrest war crimes indictees. Dragan Cavic, the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska (RS), said concrete results would be seen before the end of June."[We have] entered a serious phase of tracking and detaining war crimes suspects," Cavic told reporters after a meeting between RS officials and del Ponte in Banja Luka on Monday (31 May). 
 He held a press conference Tuesday in Plovdiv. About 360 police officers are involved in the ongoing operation, which is being conducted in co-operation with Europol and the US Secret Service and is being monitored by Bulgarian Prosecutor General Nikola Filchev. During searches of at least 47 sites in Sofia, Plovdiv, Pazardjik, Stara Zagora and Haskovo, police seized 55,000 euros in counterfeit notes of 50,100, 200 and 500 euros. The notes, particularly the 200 and 500-euro denominations, were of such a high quality that no banknote detector would recognise them as fake, Borissov said. Police also confiscated fake Thomas Cook travel cheques and eurocheques, passports and IDs, visas for the United States, Greece, Canada and other countries, computers and software disks. 
 In one of the locations police found drugs. Ten of the suspects were arrested in Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest city. 
 As a result, only the Greek Cypriot south joined the EU on 1 May. In a separate report on his mission of good offices in Cyprus, also released Wednesday, Annan said that while the Greek Cypriot "no" vote had grounded his plan, it remained the only foreseeable basis for resolving the situation. A solution, the UN chief said, "obviously requires more than a comprehensive and carefully balanced peace plan, it also needs bold and determined political leadership on both sides in the island, as well as in Greece and Turkey, all in place at the same time, ready to negotiate with determination and to convince their people of the need to compromise".Praising the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey for backing the reunification plan, Annan called for an end to the isolation of the north."I would hope the members of the Council can give a strong lead to all states to co-operate both bilaterally and in international bodies to eliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers that have the effect of isolating the Turkish Cypriots and impeding their development," Reuters quoted the UN chief as saying. But he ruled out any moves towards the recognition or assisting the secession of the Turkish Cypriot state, saying that it would run counter to Security Council resolutions. 
  Romania's Local Elections Centre on Finances  04/06/2004 With billions of euros potentially at stake, Romania's local elections are attracting an unprecedented level of interest.  By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 04/06/04 On Sunday (6 June), Romanians will go to the polls to elect mayors as well as local and county councillors. 
 "These changes will allow us to make budgetary prognosis for longer periods and to take responsibility for bigger infrastructure investments," says Cristian Anghel, the mayor of Baia Mare, a city in northwest Romania. Brussels is providing additional funds. 
 Continued upgrades to Romania's financial rating have made it easier for local councils to borrow money from the external markets. Last but not least, those controlling the local administration will be able to exercise influence on the parliamentary and presidential elections in November. More than 3,100 mayors, 34,000 local councillors and 1,400 county councillors will be elected Monday by about 16 million voters. 
  Del Ponte: Croatia Fully Co-operating With ICTY  04/06/2004 According to chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, Croatia has demonstrated full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
 The only open issue is the case of fugitive General Ante Gotovina.  (Reuters, AP, Croatian Information Centre, Radio B92 - 03/06/04)In a rare statement on Thursday (3 June), chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Croatia was now fully co-operating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)."Finally, I have come to a Balkan state that is fully co-operating," del Ponte said in Zagreb. 
 PSD candidate, Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana, won half as many votes as his opponent, incumbent Bucharest Mayor Traian Basescu. 
 Alliance co-president Theodor Stolojan, a candidate in the presidential elections, demanded that the government "co-operate with the City Hall of Bucharest".For the ruling party, the results could be a worrisome sign of things to come. 
 The candidate of the nationalist party, incumbent Mayor Gheorghe Funar, did poorly, winning only 20 per cent. 
 Many analysts expect his supporters will now back Boc. In Timisoara, Mayor Gheorghe Ciuhandu of the Christian Democrats won the first round with 67 per cent. 
 Except for the Timosoara mayoral vote, the party -- which has been out of parliament since 2000 -- had results ranging from 1 per cent to 2 per cent."The Romanian political scope is not complete," said Jonathan Scheele, the representative of the European Commission in Bucharest. 
  Reagan's Legacy Remembered  07/06/2004 Leaders from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union paid tribute to the late Ronald Reagan for helping bring down communism and changing the world.  (AP, FT, AFP, Telegraph, The Guardian, Reuters - 07/06/04; Washington Post, CNN, BBC, AP, Rompres, Novinite, BNN, Mediapool - 06/06/04)Expressing sadness over the death of former US President Ronald Reagan, leaders from Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union have praised him for helping bring down communism and changing the world."I take the death of Ronald Reagan very hard," Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, told reporters Sunday (6 June). 
  Athens Mayor: Olympics Preparations on Track  08/06/2004 Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyanni said preparations for the Summer Olympics are on track, expressing confidence that the planned security measures will ensure the safety of the Games.  (The Washington Times, Big News Network - 08/06/04; AP, Reuters, BBC, Bloomberg - 07/06/04)All preparations for the Summer Olympics are on track, Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyanni said in Washington on Monday (7 June), 67 days before the official start of the Games. 
 She voiced confidence that the security plan put in place will ensure the safety of this year's biggest sports event."We believe whatever can be done as preparations for security, we did it, and we hope everything will go well," Bakoyanni said at the Western Policy Centre, which hosted a special forum on the Athens Olympics on Monday. 
 "In this insecure world, Athens will probably be the most secure city in August 2004."Greece has allocated a budget of nearly 6.9 billion euros to prepare for the two-week Games, which open on 13 August. 
 IOC Co-ordinating Committee President Dennis Oswald echoed Bakoyanni's words in an interview for Sky Radio in Athens on Monday, saying that he is satisfied with the level of co-operation and that all projects would be completed on time. Bakoyanni arrived on a two-day visit to the United States to review the security arrangements with State Department officials and lawmakers. 
 They will be backed NATO air and sea patrols. Meanwhile, Greece's Olympic security team set out Monday on a four-day tour of the country, led by Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis. 
 "We want to activate all procedures to take the country into the Olympic period proper."Ahead of the Games, Greek officials have stepped up their co-operation with counterparts from neighbouring Bulgaria, Albania and Turkey to ensure that trafficking routes on both sides of the borders are sealed off. 
   Serbia-Montenegro and Romania Complete Joint Manoeuvres  10/06/2004 Defence ministers of Serbia-Montenegro and Romania have expressed satisfaction with last month's joint military manoeuvres -- the first Serbia-Montenegro has carried out with a NATO member.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 10/06/04 The military manoeuvres carried out by the armies of Serbia-Montenegro and Romania on 29 May were the first the Serbia-Montenegro Army has carried out with a NATO member. 
 Around 1,350 soldiers and policemen, 300 non-combat and 30 combat vehicles, as well as several airplanes, helicopters and ships were involved in the exercise. The defence ministers of Serbia-Montenegro and Romania said they were satisfied with the results and with the co-operation between the two armies. According to Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, the goal of the exercise -- fighting terrorists -- is in line with the new Serbia-Montenegro defence strategy. 
  Greece Pledges to Implement EU Anti-terrorism Measures  10/06/2004 Responding to criticism over its failure to adopt key EU anti-terrorism legislation, Greece has promised to implement the measures before the start of the Summer Olympics.  (EurActiv - 10/06/04; AFP, Kathimerini, MPA, The Guardian, EurActiv - 09/06/04; Reuters, Independent, EUobserver - 08/06/04)Greece pledged on Wednesday (9 June) to implement anti-terrorism laws agreed on by all EU member states before the start of the Athens Olympics in August. 
 He attributed the delay to the change of government in Greece."It was natural for the New Democracy government, which took over just three months ago, to wish to study the issue carefully. 
 Also on Wednesday, Dutch Defence Minister Henk Kamp met with his Greek counterpart, Spilos Spiliotopoulos, in Athens. 
  Croatia to Continue Demolition of Illegal Buildings, Despite Tourist Season  11/06/2004 Although critics warn that the move could deter tourists, the government is going ahead with the demolition of illegal buildings along Croatia's Adriatic coastline.  By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 11/06/04 Many expected that the demolition of illegally constructed buildings on the Adriatic Riviera would be halted temporarily as foreign tourists arrive for the summer season. 
 However, Tourism Minister Bozidar Kalmeta has decided to go ahead with the process, in spite of the influx. Halting the demolitions, some analysts say, would undermine the campaign while encouraging those who invest in the illegal buildings as well as bureaucrats who share responsibility for the problem. But others argue that tearing down buildings will create noise, dust and other nuisances, creating a negative impression of Croatia and thus undermining the tourist industry. In fact, the sound of bulldozers and concrete mixers has been a feature of Croatian holidays for many years, because the tourism and construction seasons usually occur at the same time. 
 Instead, they argue, government officials must take an active part in planning and preparing for the tourist season. 
 He also called for steps to improve Kosovo's stagnant economic and for a quick solution to the problem of its final status."If the international community gives up here, that would be a carte blanche for terrorism, for violence, all kind of actions against humanity," Holkeri said Thursday (10 June).Kosovo was placed under UN administration in mid-June 1999, following NATO's 78-day campaign. 
 Of that figure, 17 per cent are children ages 13 to 15.A study by the Albanian Ministry of Health, the WHO and an American research centre in Atlanta includes interviews with pupils in elementary school and the early grades of high school. 
 The UN organisation says that people from the poorest countries of the world are the most likely to be exposed to smoking and to suffer from diseases caused by smoking. 
 "Poor people spend more money for tobacco than on fulfilling other needs like food, medical care or education," concluded a report issued by WHO. 
  Del Ponte Expects Karadzic's Extradition by End of June  14/06/2004 Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic could be handed over to the UN tribunal in The Hague by the end of June, according to chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.  (The Guardian, Office of the High Representative - 14/06/04; FENA, VOA - 13/06/04; Reuters, Radio B92, CNN, The New York Times - 12/06/04)Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has voiced confidence that Radovan Karadzic will soon be handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). 
 The new rules lower the turnout threshold and shorten the campaign season, among other changes.  By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 15/06/04 Under new rules adopted by parliament, Macedonia's local elections on 17 October will be considered valid if one-third of voters in each municipality take part. 
 The election campaign will span 20 days and bilingual voting will be guaranteed in those municipalities where ethnic communities are represented by more than 20 per cent. The minimum turnout has been lowered, and a mayoral candidate can now win in the first round as long as one third of the respective municipality turns out to vote. 
 The period of campaigning has also been shortened from 30 to 20 days. According to Justice Minister Ixhet Memeti, the measures are a European-style solution aimed at making it likelier that mayoral elections are decided during the first round. The amendments to the local election laws stipulate that women should make up 30 per cent of the upper part of the lists of councilors. 
 Members of a parliamentary subcommittee in charge of analysing the campaign will be taking a closer look at the number of those arrested, indicted and sentenced. They will also investigate how many phones were tapped, who issued the requests for phone tapping, and how many of those whose phones were tapped were later indicted. Special attention is being given to events that took place in the village of Meljak, near Belgrade. 
 "We are working and we are moving with the right speed in the right direction and everybody is welcome to monitor our progress."Bulgaria is expected to step up its fight against organised crime and corruption, implement judiciary and public administration reforms, and carry out all other commitments made during the talks, including the early closure of two Soviet-era reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in 2006.Under its agreements with the EU, the country will receive 240m euros, in addition to the already announced funding of 4.4 billion euros under the Union's 2007-2009 budget. Prior to the signing of the membership treaty, expected to take place in June 2005, the European Commission will issue its regular report on Bulgaria's accession progress, to be released in October this year. 
 We are not convinced that Romania, by means of local resources, has the capacity to absorb the present large number of abandoned and orphaned children, apart from placing them on a long term in childcare institutions, which obviously does not benefit the children," the embassy said in a press release. According to parliamentary deputy Minodora Cliveti, however, the bill brings Romania's legislation in line with provisions of The Hague Convention, to which Romania is a signatory. 
 This way, Romania will take more care of its orphans or abandoned children," Cliveti said. International adoptions in Romania soared when widely broadcast television footage showed children living in squalid conditions in orphanages. 
 About 800 Serb homes and dozens of religious sites were destroyed or damaged. At a farewell press conference in Pristina last week, Holkeri described the mid-March events as a major setback for Kosovo and called on the international community to continue its efforts to stabilise the province."If the international community gives up here, that would be a carte blanche for terrorism, for violence, all kind of actions against humanity," Holkeri said. A report by Serbian state news agency Tanjug on Wednesday quoted KFOR Commander General Holger Kammerhoff as saying that NATO peacekeepers would not allow a new flare-up of violence in Kosovo. 
 For the most part, that means fast, mobile ships -- such as Kotor frigates, 401-type rocket gunboats, auxilliary ships and small submarines. The navy's operational requirements are changing, Rajicevic said, reflecting Serbia-Montenegro's goal of becoming a part of integrated security activities in the Adriatic-Ionian region. In general, reforms are proceeding at a fast clip. 
 That is why he attended a training programme organised by the American Bar Association's Central European and Eurasian Law Initiative (ABA-CEELI)."We're expecting a large number of cases from The Hague," said Soldat, referring to the so-called Rules of the Road cases, in which The Hague war crimes tribunal approves evidence gathered by local prosecutors before the prosecutors can issue warrants and prosecute cases. Such cases, and co-operation with the tribunal, were the main points of the recent two-day training in Banja Luka for about two dozen RS prosecutors, judges and defence lawyers. Because the tribunal will be finishing trials by 2008 and appeals by 2010, and because Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) state-level war crimes chamber that should begin work in 2005 will be able to handle between 50 and 100 cases in five years, entity courts should ideally be vigorously prosecuting Rules of the Road cases sent back from The Hague. 
 Mayor Dumitru Sechelariu, a prominent local party baron, received only 37 per cent of the vote; victory went to the Romanian Humanist Party. 
 It is in Europe's interest that the hole gets filled with a European quality of life," says Draskovic. Public opinion researchers agree that the margin of victory will be slim, and that voter turnout will be decisive. 
 NATO missions in Afghanistan and the Balkans, partnerships with the EU, Caucasus and Central Asia, and measures against terrorism are expected to top the agenda at the summit.  By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 24/06/04 NATO's 26 heads of state and government will assemble in Istanbul on Monday (28 June), to discuss partnerships with the EU, the Caucasus and Central Asia, as well as NATO missions in Afghanistan and the Balkans. 
  OSCE Nations Urged to Focus on Non-conventional Threats  24/06/2004 Participants in the OSCE's two-day Annual Security Review Conference have emphasised the risk of asymmetric and non-conventional threats and the need to keep chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials out of the wrong hands.  (OSCE, VOA, AFP, Washington File, BNN, Novinite - 23/06/04)Participants in an annual OSCE security conference have urged member nations to focus on the increased risk of non-conventional threats, as they continue to address practical issues in the fight against global terrorism. Opening the organisation's two-day Annual Security Review Conference in Vienna on Wednesday (23 June), OSCE Chairman-in-Office Solomon Passy -- who is also Bulgaria's foreign minister -- noted the body's progress in improving air travel safety and the security of borders and passports."But let us challenge ourselves even further by admitting that putting into practice our current commitments might not be enough," Passy said. 
 "In view of recent research indicating the increased risk of asymmetric and non-conventional threats, we should devote more attention to the danger posed by chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials."Addressing about 350 political and military experts attending the Vienna forum, Passy stressed the need for OSCE countries to tighten the security at sites storing conventional explosives, so that they do not end up in terrorists' hands."Other areas we need to build on include the security of containers, in which around 90 per cent of the world's goods are shipped, protecting our energy infrastructure from possible attack and countering the use of the Internet by terrorists as a tool for communications and propaganda," he said. Deputy US Homeland Security Secretary Admiral James Loy voiced similar concerns, warning that in recent years there have been "too many incidents of radiological materials finding their way . outside the normal control mechanisms of nations".As a means to improve the security of shipments, Loy proposed that OSCE states standardise the development of electronic seals that protect container cargo from tampering and develop a uniform system for exchanging customs data in a regularised format. Another measure he proposed was to incorporate interoperable biometric indicators on passports and visas while developing a set of international standards for capturing, analysing, storing, and protecting biometric data. While noting "conventional attacks are more likely at the moment," EU Counterterrorism Co-ordinator Gijs de Vries cautioned OSCE countries to be prepared for attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. 
  NATO to Provide Security Assistance to Greece During Olympics  25/06/2004 NATO has agreed to provide security assistance to the Greek government during the Summer Olympics and the Paralympic Games in Athens.  (The Guardian - 25/06/04; NATO, Reuters, AP, VOA, Kathimerini, Macedonian Press Agency - 24/06/04)Responding to a Greek request, NATO has agreed to provide security assistance during the Summer Olympics and the Paralympic Games, which Athens will host in August and September of this year. NATO issued a statement Thursday (24 June), specifying the package of measures approved by its chief decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, a day earlier. 
 In addition, seven planes will assist the Greeks in patrolling the airspace over the Aegean Sea. NATO also is reportedly offering an eight-ship fleet to assist in maritime surveillance in Aegean and Ionian international waters, while Greek military vessels patrol national waters. Furthermore, a unit of about 100 Czech chemical and biological alert troops from NATO's recently established battalion for defence against weapons of mass destruction are to be deployed on the ground. 
 About 30,000 security personnel will be deployed, including sea and air units.  By Vahit Bora for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 25/06/04 As Istanbul prepares to host the 3,000 participants and 3,500 journalists who will attend the NATO summit beginning Monday (28 June), maximum efforts are being focused on security measures. 
 About 30,000 security personnel will be on duty during the two-day event, including sea and air units. The area around summit venues will be closed to traffic. 
 Oil and gas tankers, as well as vessels carrying explosives or flammable cargo, will not be allowed through. 
 Sea barriers will be placed around the Dolmabahce and Ciragan palaces, where NATO participants will stay. Turkish and US security forces will co-operate to ensure the security of the US delegation, comprising about 1,000. 
 A wireless Internet access (Wi-Fi) network is in place, and a special high-capacity switchboard will be set up near the Lutfi Kirdar Convention and Exhibition Centre and Military Museum. 
 According to officials, 250 cars, 150 minibuses and 100 buses will be used for transportation. Health centres will be set up at the venue of the summit and hotels where the delegates will stay. 
 It criticised RS in particular for not having tracked down and apprehended even one indictee over the past nine years, stressing that Cavic's statement must be followed by deeds. RS "is failing to carry out a key obligation under Dayton and international law, for which the relevant individuals and institutions must be held accountable", the statement added. The steering board also voiced support for changes the top international envoy in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, could make to BiH's security structures, to ensure the country fulfils its international obligations and to hold those obstructing the process accountable politically."I will consider all the possible measures and take corresponding decisions very soon after we have received a reply from Istanbul," local media quoted Ashdown as saying. 
 It is unacceptable that the country be held hostage by some people in RS, he added. On Saturday and Sunday, Bosnian Serb special police searched for two war crimes indictees, Savo Todovic and Stojan Zupljanin, but located neither of them. In other news, NATO decided in Istanbul on steps to terminate SFOR by the end of this year and hand over its responsibilities to an EU-led force. 
  World's Largest Shipping Exhibition Held in Athens  29/06/2004 More than 20,000 visitors attended the Posidonia trade show, the largest of its kind worldwide. 
 The exhibition demonstrated Greece's pivotal role in the international shipping industry and was considered a major test event ahead of the Summer Olympics.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 29/06/04 Just two months before the start of the Summer Olympics, host city Athens held the largest shipping industry trade show in the world. 
 The Greek shipping industry boasts 4,000 vessels with a total capacity of 170m dead weight tonnage (dwt) and a current order book of 400 new building berths at major international shipyards. This year's exhibition was also considered a major test event for Greece ahead of the Summer Games in August. Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who attended the trade show, spoke about the immense contribution the shipping industry has made to the country's economy. 
 He paid tribute to the hard work of Greek ship owners and seafarers, praising them for establishing the Greek-owned fleet as the largest in the world. Greek Mercantile Marine Minister Manolis Kefaloyiannis and Turkish Minister of Transport Binali Yildirim both visited Posidonia and toured exhibitor pavilions."The importance of Greece to the maritime world, as well as the importance of the shipping sector to Greece, are two facts which cannot be disputed. 
 "The Afghan people need that security today, not tomorrow," he said. While in Istanbul, US President George W. Bush addressed students at Galatasaray University. 
 Against the backdrop of the Ortakoy Mosque and the Bosphorus Bridge, which links Europe and Asia, he answered criticism of his policies and sought to reassure Muslim nations."Some people in Muslim cultures identify democracy with the worst of Western popular culture and want no part of it," he said. 
 Western and local officials have voiced concerns that the process might not have been carried out fairly and professionally. Kosovo's acting UN administrator, Charles Brayshaw, requested in a letter to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) that all actions related to the tender be suspended, UNMIK spokeswoman Mechtilde Henneke said Tuesday (29 June). 
 An AFP report Monday suggested that Mobikos's bid had been accepted ahead of those submitted by other competitors -- including Kosovo provider IPKO, which submitted its bid in co-operation with US-based Western Wireless International, Sweden's Tele2 and the Norwegian-Albanian company Albacell. Anton Berisha, the head of the TRA board, said Mobikos had submitted the strongest bid, praising what he described as a "clear business plan and a detailed technical plan".But the board's decision aroused suspicions of possible wrongdoing and corruption on the part of the regulator, and was met with swift reactions from Western diplomats and Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi. The chief of the US office in Pristina, Marcie B. Ries, questioned the speed with which the decision was taken and called for a careful review of the process. 
 Ashdown also authorised an audit of a Sokolac-based forestry company thought to be financing support netwroks for war crimes indictees. As the arrest of war crimes suspects has depended on efforts by RS police -- limited to one failed raid in April and another last week -- Ashdown announced that police reform would include giving more power to the state-level police structures."Our priority will be to ensure that the law-abiding citizens of this country get a police force that is structured in order to serve their interests, not the interests of a corrupt few," Ashdown said. Senad Slatina, an analyst with the Brussels-based International Crisis Group in Sarajevo, said the measures were long overdue and would be effective, especially once the command responsibility over the police is shifted from the hands of the entities to those of the stateEU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten and the UN's chief war crimes prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, both expressed support for the sanctions imposed by Ashdown. On Wednesday, the RS government convened an emergency session to discuss the removal of Djeric and Industry Minister Milan Bogicevic, whose name was also on the list of dismissals. 
 Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg has stressed the importance of Bulgaria's newly coined relations with Washington and Brussels to enhancing security and creating economic opportunities. 
 Tadic's statement came a day after chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Serbia-Montenegro over its lack of co-operation with the ICTY. 
 Film and theatre programmes, as well as public panels, will also be held. Some Novi Sad politicians, mostly members of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, have openly advocated the festival's closure, saying that city funds earmarked for EXIT should be redirected to reconstruction of damaged Serbian churches. However, the city's tourist organisation says EXIT has helped put Novi Sad back on the cultural map -- the festival has attracted 800,000 visitors in four years, including a significant number from abroad. 
 In addition, there were "indications of repeated, multiple and flagrant breaches of electoral law".In other news Thursday, SFOR peacekeepers backed by local police carried out a search operation in the eastern town of Han Pijesak, the main wartime base of former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic. Both Karadzic and Mladic have been charged with genocide by the UN tribunal for their roles in the 1992-1995 war in BiH.SFOR spokesman Marc Hope said the search was part of normal framework operations conducted by peacekeepers. 
  Macedonia to Receive 47.4m Euros from EU for 2004  05/07/2004 Funds from a CARDS Financial Agreement will be used in four key areas: economic and social development, reform of the judiciary and internal affairs, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, and environmental protection.  By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 05/07/04 Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska and Donato Chiarini, the head of the European Commission's delegation in Macedonia, signed a CARDS Financial Agreement on 24 June, under which the country will receive 47.4m euros. 
 "The support we are providing in that direction will be essential and precious in advancing the objectives on our mutual agenda."According to Sekerinska, the funds will go towards four key areas: economic and social development, reform of the judiciary and internal affairs, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, and environmental protection. 
 The annual action programme for 2004 will be carried out by the EU Agency for Reconstruction and Development's office in Skopje. Daniel Giuglaris, who heads the office, says it began with 202m euros in 2002 and has spent a total of 158m euros. 
 Last year, the amount spent was 34.5m euros. Of the CARDS funds, about 22.5m euros are intended to support economic and social development, including aid to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 
 Such reforms will be carried out through a newly established institution for the training of judges in line with European standards. Support for democracy and the rule of law has been allotted 3m euros. 
 In May, the government decided to revive the Belene project to ensure the country's leading position in the Balkan electricity market following the closure of four reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. Bulgaria started building a second nuclear power plant at Belene, about 250km northeast of Sofia, in the 1980s. 
 Reuters quoted Kovachev as saying the company would apply for a loan of up to 350m euros from the EU's Euroatom fund and from credit export agencies of the contracted consortium for the plant. The state will keep between 51 per cent and 80 per cent of the shares of the company, but shares will also be offered to local companies and municipalities, emulating an approach used in Finland. Bulgaria will invite the three multinational consortiums that have expressed interest in the project to submit their final bids by late autumn. The economy, finance and energy ministers, together with experts from the National Electricity Company, will shortlist the technologies and contractors by the end of this year, before the contracts are signed in early 2005, Kovachev said. He cited nuclear safety and the price of Belene-generated electricity as the key criteria in the selection process. 
  Greece Welcomes Euro 2004 Champions, Looks Ahead to Olympics  06/07/2004 Greeks took to the streets Monday to celebrate the national football team's triumph at the Euro 2004 championship in Portugal. 
 The victory is being hailed as the best possible advertisement for next month's Olympics.  (The Scotsman, Telegraph - 06/07/04; Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, CNN, VOA, Kathimerini - 05/07/04; Official Athens 2004 Web site)Hundreds of thousands of Greeks lined streets in Athens on Monday (5 July), welcoming home the national football team after its triumph at the Euro 2004 championship in Portugal. 
 Initially viewed as an outsider, the Greek squad marched steadily to Sunday's final and to a 1-0 victory over host Portugal, resulting in its first ever European title. More than 35,000 fans gathered at the Panathinaikon Stadium in central Athens -- the site of the first modern Olympics in 1896 -- to see the 23 players and their German coach Otto Rehhagel lift the cup and sing the national anthem. 
 The team's stunning success prompted celebrations elsewhere in Greece, as well as in other countries with sizeable Greek communities. With just weeks before the Summer Olympics open in Athens on 13 August, officials and ordinary citizens hailed the soccer win as the best possible advertisement for the Games. 
 Organisers hope it would boost sluggish ticket sales. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who attended the final in Lisbon, said Greece was now on everyone's lips."These boys taught us a lesson as to what Greeks can do when we really believe in something, when we are united and have self-confidence, dynamism and method in achieving it," Karamanlis said Monday, addressing the packed stadium. Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni also joined the celebrations. 
 "This is the biggest and best message for the Olympic Games: that Athens is here, everything is wonderful, we filled this stadium, and another 100,000 are outside," Bakoyianni said."We showed that Greece has changed," the AFP quoted opposition leader and former Foreign Minister George Papandreou as saying Monday. 
 It's so rare to have them all in one exhibition."For Xhovalin Delia, an Albanian artist living in Florence, Italy, the event was "similar to the call of your own father to return to your home country".During communism, notes UNHCR representative in Albania Marion Hoffman, artists "had to either perform according to the rules of dictatorship, or work in hiding, or flee . 
  Croatia Tackles Computer Crime  08/07/2004 Cybercrime -- including child pornography, the creation and spread of viruses, and illegal intrusions into networks -- has been on the rise in Croatia, but police are working hard to respond to the challenge.  By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 08/07/04 Croatia's Interior Ministry has announced the results of an international police action aimed at breaking up an Internet child pornography ring. 
 These and other actions are part of government efforts to crack down on computer-related crimes, as required by the Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty. The treaty, ratified by Croatia in 2001, went into effect on 1 July. 
 Albania, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania are among the other nations that have ratified the treaty, which includes arrangements for mutual assistance and extradition. The Croatian Interior Ministry established a computer crime department in 2003, in response to a 15 per cent annual rise in this type of criminal activity. 
 The international dimension of this problem requires such an approach," said the computer crime department's deputy chief, Ognjen Hramin. 
 He is believed to be hiding in Serbia, though authorities in Belgrade deny that. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Pavkovic, Lazarevic, Djordjevic and Lukic in October 2003 over their alleged involvement in war crimes committed during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo. Urging the authorities to hand over the indictees, Grossman said they should do so not in order to please Washington or Brussels, but because "it's right for the Serbian people" and because Belgrade has an obligation to fulfil."It's time for Mr Mladic to be in The Hague. 
 Rather, he said, they must be met."We don't want to be an isolated island in the sea of European democracies. 
 I will carry out my mandate as prime minister, but in the forthcoming period I will reshuffle the governmental team," Nastase said. He acknowledged there had been rumours he would step down from the party post because of the PSD's poor showing in the recent local elections. 
 "We had a situation after these elections and I considered all options, including my resignation as president of the party," he said. Romanian President Ion Iliescu, considered the PSD's spiritual father, has sharply criticised the party's top leaders over the election results, charging that they have lost touch with voters and failed to distance themselves from individuals accused of corruption. 
  Fruit-Freezing Factory Opens in BiH  12/07/2004 The first Foreign Direct Investment in the Srebrenica area has resulted in the opening of a freezer factory for the export of organic berries grown by local farmers.  By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 12/07/04 A fruit-freezing factory that opened in Potocari last month is not only the result of the first Foreign Direct Investment in this part of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) since the 1990s conflict, but also marks a shift from the region's old reliance on industry, and benefits dozens of people in a region known mostly for a horrific wartime massacre. Swedish company Olle Svensson invested 500,000 euros in the Bos Agro Food factory, which will freeze organic raspberries bought from local farmers. A lot choked with waist-high weeds contains the abandoned battery factory where thousands of Muslim men were executed by Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995. 
 But the gleaming white building in the middle of all of this can be seen as a sign that the municipality has the chance for future prosperity."After everything we've survived, we have the right to better times," said Srebrenica Mayor Abdurahman Malkic. 
 Party vice presidents Dan Ioan Popescu, Viorel Hrebenciuc and Doru Ioan Taracila -- the respective heads of the Bucharest, Bacau and Calarasi PSD branches -- were among those affected. Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana, defeated in the Bucharest mayoral vote, was removed from his position as executive president of Bucharest's PSD branch while he was in Istanbul attending the NATO summit. 
 "It was not a friendly procedure," he said. Another case involves Dumitru Sechelariu, a prominent local party baron, who lost the mayoral position in Bacau after having held it for 12 years. 
 Sechelariu decided to exit the PSD, announcing that he would make "spectacular disclosures" about party leaders. The election aftermath has also seen a rift develop between Nastase and President Ion Iliescu, considered the party's spiritual father. 
 Prior to his murder, Pantic had reportedly received numerous telephone threats."Many connected his murder to the underground in the Morava River region," said Branislav Jovanovic, a journalist with Radio-Television Jagodina. 
 Analysts have suggested that Karic's recent political activism may have been driven by the wish to protect his business interests. At the same time, state-owned Telekom Srbija has accused Mobtel of conducting illegal telephone traffic. 
  Albania Modernises Its Health Care System  19/07/2004 Authorities are preparing a bill to reform the health care system, giving citizens more options in choosing where they will receive treatment.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 19/07/04 Albania is preparing to reform its health care system, giving more autonomy to hospitals, clinics and other medical centres throughout the country and allowing citizens greater choice in choosing where they will receive treatment."Albanians will be free to choose the medical institutions where they would prefer treatment. 
 The legislation would offer citizens the opportunity to obtain a health insurance document providing for free treatment; those without the document would have to pay. According to Leka, the new bill also provides for a limited amount of subsidised health care for citizens who are travelling abroad. Albanian Minister of Health Leonard Solis has described the proposed legislation as a key step in consolidating the country's health care system. 
 Economics, Solis argues, conditions the actual state of health care in Albania. 
  Serbia-Montenegro to Step up Fight Against Human Trafficking  19/07/2004 OSCE-sponsored research has found there are more than 1,134 human trafficking victims in Serbia-Montenegro, and the country is increasingly becoming not only a transit point but also a destination for trafficked persons.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 19/07/04 This year's report by the US State Department on global human trafficking placed Serbia-Montenegro on the "Tier 2 watch list". 
 The watch list -- a new addition to the four-year-old survey -- contains countries that are not yet in compliance with US legal standards and may be downgraded, but have promised to make or are in the process of making significant efforts to meet the requirements. Research by the Victims' Association of Serbia for the OSCE Mission in Belgrade found there are more than 1,134 human trafficking victims in Serbia-Montenegro, including 940 women, 94 children and 100 men. 
  Greek Cypriots Propose Confidence-Building Measures  19/07/2004 Athens has welcomed a series of measures proposed by Greek Cypriot authorities, saying they would boost security and encourage co-operation among the two communities on the divided island. 
 Ankara remains cautious.  (Turkish Press, Athens News Agency - 18/07/04; International herald tribune, VOA - 17/07/04; AP, Reuters, BBC, VOA - 16/07/04)Athens has welcomed a set of confidence-building measures outlined by Greek Cypriot authorities, describing them as beneficial for both communities on the divided island. 
 We'll evaluate [the proposal] with our [Turkish Cypriot] friends and then we will make a decision," said Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. Meanwhile, an EU official said that measures to establish a climate of confidence on the island would be welcome and that Brussels would analyse the initiative. In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States "would welcome any and all mutually agreed steps that can reduce military tensions in Cyprus", but stressed that military confidence building was "no substitute" for the comprehensive settlement envisioned in Annan's plan. 
  Slovenia to Help Pave Way for Montenegro's EU Accession  20/07/2004 Urging political transparency and consensus, Slovenian European Integration Minister Milan Cvikl said in Podgorica that his country stands ready to assist Montenegro as it carries out the political and economic reforms needed for EU accession.  By Antonela Krstovic for Southeast European Times in Podgorica - 20/07/04 Slovenia stands ready to assist Montenegro in its path towards EU membership, Slovenian European Integration Minister Milan Cvikl said during his visit to Podgorica last month. 
 Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted the president as urging indictees to remove the burden of responsibility from the public and assume it themselves. De Hoop Scheffer also met on Monday with Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic. In other news, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Monday charged that the Serbian government leaked information about indictee Goran Hadzic on 13 July. 
 At a press conference, she said that a couple of hours after the tribunal handed over the indictment to the foreign ministry, Hadzic was seen leaving, carrying a large bag. 
 It is intended to synchronise operations of the Albanian and Montenegrin power systems, as well as contributing to the overall strength and flexibility of electricity networks in Southeastern Europe. 
 According to Reuters, the document, proposed by RS President Dragan Cavic, was supported by a huge majority of the MPs in the entity's 83-seat assembly. The international community has made it clear that BiH's chances for Euro-Atlantic integration hinge on full co-operation with the ICTY, including the handover of suspects indicted for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
  Olympic Security Budget Exceeds 1.2 Billion Euros  22/07/2004 The security budget of the Athens Olympics has climbed by another 25 per cent, topping 1.2 billion euros. 
 With three weeks to go before the opening ceremony, Greek officials expect costs to rise even further.  (The Washington Post, Independent, The Scotsman - 22/07/04; AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC, CNN, VOA, UPI - 21/07/04)The security budget of the Athens Olympics is up another 25 per cent, reaching over 1.2 billion euros, a Greek official said Wednesday (21 July). 
 Doukas attributed the new budget increase to a growing international security demand. Much of the security budget so far has been spent on high tech surveillance equipment, new weaponry, patrol boats, and a 255m-euro contract with a US-led consortium for a security network. 
 According to Doukas, the new costs include more than 2m euros for a blimp outfitted with high-resolution cameras and chemical detection systems. To guarantee the security of the Summer Olympics, the first Summer Olympics to be held since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, Greece has been working with a seven-nation advisory group, which includes Britain, Israel and the United States. 
 Athens also asked NATO for support following the March terrorist bombings in Madrid, which killed 191 people, and the Alliance is now considering a second Greek request. 
 However, authorities have said that teams participating in the Olympics will not be allowed to bring their own armed security guards, as the country's constitution does not permit foreigners to bear arms on Greek soil. Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis said Wednesday that only security personnel accompanying national leaders would be allowed to carry guns, on the basis of international protocols."As far as the Games are concerned, it is clear that Greek authorities have the exclusive responsibility, and they have done everything humanly possible for the Games to be held in a safe and peaceful environment," Voulgarakis said. In Washington, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld played down reports that the United States would send 400 Special Forces soldiers, noting that the force would be under NATO rather than US auspices."It wouldn't involve US troops per se, it would be only a NATO mission. 
 The same day, the main seaport in Athens was closed for two hours to allow divers to install an underwater monitoring system, part of a vast network of sensors and cameras designed to safeguard the Olympics. In other news, two Molotov cocktails were thrown at a building associated with the Olympics early Thursday. 
 Tadic stressed that Serbia's main goal is to access the European and NATO integration processes.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 23/07/04 Newly elected Serbian President Boris Tadic started his five-year mandate with a visit to Washington this week, emphasising that Serbia's main goal is to access the European and NATO integration processes. Tadic met with top US officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and several senators, congressmen and business leaders. 
 He was unable to specify when Mladic might be arrested or whether he was in Serbia, as ICTY chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte has insisted. 
 In talks with Powell and Cheney, Tadic said that economic co-operation between Belgrade and Washington is essential to Serbia's economic stability. 
 The court threw out the case on procedural grounds, sending the matter back to parliament.  By Mustafa Azizoglu for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 26/07/04 Turkey's Supreme Court rejected a decision by parliament to send former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his economy minister, Gunes Taner, to trial on charges stemming from the privatisation of a state bank in 1998.An overwhelming number of parliamentary deputies had approved the decision, which was part of a larger inquiry into alleged large-scale fraud affecting privatisation schemes, banking reforms and energy projects, thought to be costing Turkey billions of euros. Of the 447 deputies present in the 550-seat parliament, 429 voted in favour of a draft law which would have made Yilmaz the first prime minister in Turkish history to stand trial. 
 However, he became politically vulnerable after the 2002 general elections, when his Motherland Party failed to win a single seat in parliament. 
  Security Drill Tests Olympic Transportation  26/07/2004 A drill aimed at testing the safety of Olympic transportation was conducted in Athens on Sunday (25 July). 
 With less than three weeks until the opening ceremony on 13 August, Greek officials say every scenario for a possible terrorist attack is being considered. The focus of Sunday's drill was on managing traffic accidents with the help of a high-tech blimp, which made its first test flight over Athens on Friday, and on checking the operation of special Olympic traffic routes. 
 Air and ground police units took part in the operation, conducted along key roads in the greater Athens area. The three-hour exercise, codenamed "Olympic Hermes", also tested part of an electronic security network, two days after it was declared fully operational. 
 Equipped with high-resolution cameras and chemical contamination "sniffers", it will patrol the skies over Athens for at least 16 hours a day during the Games, flying at a height of more than 1,200m. 
 Images from its cameras -- as well as from cameras installed at Olympic venues, on major streets, and on helicopters and airplanes -- will be fed into a security command centre."Greece is ready," Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said Friday as the security network was declared up and running. 
 "Greece will host ... absolutely successful games in conditions of supreme safety."The security budget for the Games has reached a record 1.2 billion euros -- three times the amount the country initially planned to spend -- as it seeks to ensure the safety of the first Summer Olympics to be held since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. 
 Authorities say the amount will likely rise even further. In other news, the Greek daily  Kathimerini  reported Saturday that a 1.6m-euro high-tech mobile laboratory designed to help protect the Olympics against potential biological or chemical attacks would be set up near Halkida, about 70km north of Athens, by the end of this month. 
 In response to a Greek request for assistance, the Alliance has also agreed to provide AWACS surveillance planes to help maintain a no-fly zone over Athens, as well as other security support. Greece is also being assisted in its security preparations by a seven-nation advisory group, which includes Britain, Israel and the United States. 
  NATO Agrees to Provide Additional Olympics Security Assistance  27/07/2004 NATO has approved "in essence" a request by the Greek government for additional counterterrorism assistance during next month's Athens Olympics.  (New York Daily News - 27/07/04; AP, USA Today, NATO, Kathimerini, Reuters - 26/07/04)NATO has reportedly agreed to a Greek government request for additional security support during next month's Olympics in Athens. 
 Last month, NATO said the support would include airspace patrolling by AWACS aircraft. In an interview with the Athens-based daily  Kathimerini  published on Monday, Greek Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis attributed the requests for NATO support to "gaps in equipment, expertise, or staff" encountered during drills. 
 Armed patriot missiles were in position at three locations around Athens, including a military base near the Olympic Village."This is the start of the operations. 
 Made up of top officials from both constituent republics and headed by Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Llajic, it has been tasked with taking immediate steps towards full co-operation, which the federal government has described as a strategic priority. But haggling continues over who has jurisdiction over extraditing accused indictees, with some saying it is up to the council, and others calling on Serbian officials to take measures. Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, meanwhile, continues to voice concern that talk about increased co-operation has yet to translate into concrete action. 
  Greece Steps up Maritime Security for Olympics  29/07/2004 As Greece's security plan for the Athens Olympics swings into full gear, authorities say dozens of warships are already patrolling the country's waters.  (AP, CNN, Deutsche Welle, Kathemerini, Macedonian Press Agency - 28/07/04; AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC, Macedonian Press Agency - 27/07/04)As the start of the Athens Olympics approaches, Greece's unprecedented security plan for the Games is swinging into full gear. 
 Dozens of Greek warships have begun patrolling coastal waters, a naval official said Wednesday (28 July), a day after armed Patriot missiles were deployed around Athens and surveillance cameras were switched on. As part of the 1.2 billion-euro security plan, which includes a two-layer maritime security zone, at least 35 Greek vessels will be monitoring the Ionian Sea, the Aegean Sea and areas off the coasts of Crete and the Cyclades islands until the end of August. NATO warships will patrol in the second zone, outside Greek territorial waters. 
 The Greek ships are being backed by about ten navy helicopters and two military patrol aircraft. Security measures have also been tightened at the port of Piraeus, less than 10km south of central Athens. 
 Two large-scale X-ray machines, loaned by the United States, were recently installed, and US Customs and Border Patrol staff are assisting port officials in identifying potentially risky cargo. The X-ray machines can rapidly scan entire containers for terrorist weapons. 
 The new proposals, however, will allow free trade with Northern Cyprus except for foodstuffs. Among potential EU-financed projects, Verheugen listed examples such as sewage treatment plants, the rehabilitation of copper mines, and -- in the longer term -- tourism ventures, agricultural support and infrastructure projects involving electricity and telecommunications. 
 Dejan Milenkovic was arrested in Thessaloniki in mid-July.  (AP, Beta, Radio B92 - 29/07/04; AP, Reuters, BBC - 17/07/04)Belgrade has formally asked Greece to extradite a key suspect in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, a senior Serbia-Montenegro official said Thursday (29 July).On 16 July, Dejan Milenkovic, 34, was detained in the Greek port city of Thessaloniki on an international warrant."We've been on the case for a month and a half, since his wife came to Greece in early June," local police chief Costas Tzekis told reporters following Milenkovic's arrest. 
 When he was detained, the suspect was carrying a travel bag with "a lot of money", but was unarmed and had no identification papers on him, Tzekis said. Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, whose ministry deals with extradition demands, told the Beta news agency Thursday that the formal extradition request was accompanied by more than 100 pages of documentation, translated into Greek. 
 He said he hoped the Greek authorities would act quickly and efficiently on Belgrade's request. Greek law allows Milenkovic to appeal any extradition motion, according to the AP.Serbian prosecutors say Milenkovic, also known as Bugsy, was a member of the Zemun Clan organised crime group, believed to have orchestrated the plot against Djindjic. Serbia's first democratically elected prime minister since World War II was killed by sniper fire as he stepped from his car outside the Serbian government headquarters on 12 March 2003. 
 He was the driver of a truck that swerved into the lane in which Djindjic's motorcade was traveling and nearly hit the car carrying the prime minister. 
 It is widely expected that some of the tourists flocking to Athens this summer will also pay a visit to neighbouring Bulgaria. 
 While the death penalty had already been taken off of the books, the law still made it possible to impose it during wartime and other crisis situations. In addition, the amended TCK sets penalties of one to three years' imprisonment for anyone preventing individuals from participating in activities, becoming a member of a political party, or voicing their political, religious and social opinions and beliefs. 
 It bans virginity tests for women and stipulates jail terms ranging from three months to one year for those who carry out such examinations -- except if demanded by a public prosecutor as part of a criminal proceeding. The legislation also increases penalties for ordinary crimes, such as mugging, and bans the secret tapping of phone conversations. 
 An article that would have allowed students wearing headscarves to enrol in universities was dropped by the ruling Justice and Development Party, which drafted the bill together with the Republican People's Party. Besides amending the TCK, the 9th package of reforms also eliminates the right of the Turkish General Staff to appoint members to the Higher Education Board, the National Security Council and the Supreme Board of Radio and Television. 
  Macedonian Olympic Team Includes Veteran Athletes, Newcomers  03/08/2004 Macedonia's 10-member Olympic team will compete in wrestling, swimming, track and field, shooting and kayak racing. 
 The country is pinning its medal hopes on wrestler Mogamed Ibragimov, who won a bronze at the Sydney Games.  By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 03/08/04 Macedonia became the first nation Monday (2 August) to hold a national flag-raising ceremony at the Athens Olympic Village. 
 The 24-member Macedonian delegation was welcomed by the mayor of the Village, Ioannis Manos."It is with great pleasure and honour that we welcome you. 
 He is part of a 10-member team which will compete in five sports: wrestling, swimming, track and field, shooting, and kayak flatwater racing. Also in wrestling, Sihamir Osmanov will be making his Olympic debut. 
 In Athens, Miladinovski will compete in the 100m butterfly and 200m individual medley. 
  Albania's Olympic Team Largest Yet  04/08/2004 Seven Olympic athletes will represent Albania at the Summer Games in Athens, which start on 13 August.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 04/08/04 At a ceremony late last month, Deputy Prime Minister Namik Dokle presented the Albanian flag to the country's Olympic team members. 
 The torch travelled by boat across Lake Prespa to the point where Albania, Greece and Macedonia meet. 
 Spectators in other boats set off fireworks as it reached the white buoy marking the three-nation border."Athens 2004 is an event that gives us hope for the future. 
 We are sending to Athens a small team, but the qualities of the athletes are appreciated. 
 I do hope that this flag I am handing to Klodiana Shala will be waved in Athens for the good results of all the Albanian athletes," Dokle said at the ceremony last month. 
 Following last month's unprecedented football triumph at the European Championships in Portugal, the country has its sights set on further triumphs in Athens.  By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 05/08/04 This month's Olympic Games in Athens represent the return of the world's most important sports event to its birthplace. 
 Other athletes with the potential to medal include Katerina Thanou (100m) and Fani Chalkia (400m hurdle).The Greeks were victorious in taekwondo and gymnastics during the last Olympics .This time around, Michalis Mouroutsos will be competing in taekwondo, while Dimosthenis Tabakos and Vlassis Maras are determined to win big in gymnastics. Following the national football team's success at the European Championship in Portugal last month -- considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of football -- Greeks hope the Summer Games will bring further triumphs. 
  Turkey's Expectations High for Athens Olympics  06/08/2004 Wrestling and weightlifting have traditionally been Turkey's strongest Olympic sports, but this year the country is also hoping for medals in track and field. 
 Referred to by Turks as "Golden Girl" and "Girl of the Wind", she is expected to win a gold medal in Athens. Also favoured for a medal is Elvan Abeylegesse, who achieved a world record (14.24.68) in the 5000m two months ago in the Golden League in Norway -- another first in Turkish sports history. Turkish Athletics Federation President Mehmet Yurdadon, a former long-distance runner, has said he expects as many as five medals in track and field, including gold for Ayhan and Abeylegesse. 
 This year, ten weightlifters -- six men and four women -- will compete in Athens. 
 The most popular is Halil Mutlu (56kg) who took home gold medals from Barcelona and Sydney. Youth and Sports General Director Mehmet Atalay predicts that Mutlu will be the first Turkish athlete to win a medal at Athens, and will inspire the others. 
 "I believe the Turkish team will have a historic achievement," he says. Surprises are also possible in sports such as taekwondo, swimming and judo. 
 Whatever the final medal count, the Olympic Spirit will boost fraternity and peace between the two sides of the Aegean Sea. 
  Croatians Aim for Olympic Glory  09/08/2004 Croatian athletes will be competing in ten events at the Summer Olympics in Athens. 
 The public is counting on the handball and water polo teams to bring home the gold.  By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 09/08/04 Croatians consider themselves a powerful sports nation, and the Summer Games in Athens are being welcomed as an opportunity for athletes to show their best. 
 As they showed in the World Championship tournament in Portugal in 2003, a surprise is always possible -- even with injuries. The Croatian water polo team, meanwhile, is traveling to Athens with high expectations. 
 And there are other Croatian athletes who could turn in a medal-winning performance -- for example, weightlifter Nikolai Pesalov, who beat a tough field in order to win gold at the 2000 Games in Sydney. Other Croatian athletes will compete in rowing, wrestling, taekwondo, swimming, athletics and table tennis. In all, Croatian athletes have won seven medals at the Summer Olympics -- two gold, two silver and three bronze medals -- since the country gained independence. 
  Romanian Olympic Team Has Moderate Hopes for Athens  10/08/2004 Romania is sending a team of 112 athletes to the Olympic Games in Athens and hopes to win medals in gymnastics, canoe/kayak, fencing and shooting.  By Gelu Trandafir for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 10/08/04 Romania's goal for the Athens Olympics is to be placed among the top 15 nations. 
 With the exception of its gymnasts, however, this year's Olympic team is facing age as a hurdle. In women's gymnastics, Athens 2004 could provide a good opportunity for rising stars such as Catalina Ponor. 
 Swimmer Diana Mocanu, a two-time medallist, did not qualify for Athens. 
 In track, Gabriela Szabo is the defending 5000m champion, but has suffered a sharp decline in her recent performances."The Romanians [are going] to Athens with a generation worn out by age, with Olympic medallists from eight or even 16 years ago," says sports journalist Lauretiu Ciornei. 
 Nowadays, athletes prefer to train individually, somewhere abroad, and there are no resources to switch to another system."This crisis is especially severe for team sports such as handball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, basketball, in which Romania will not be represented at the Athens Games. 
 The labour ministry, the National Employment Service and local employment offices across the country will complete the study, which is being supported financially by the European Commission as part of the CARDS programme."Albania's economic and social development is impossible without the development of human resources," Labour Minister Engjell Bejtaj said as he launched the initiative earlier this year. 
 This is because athletic culture in Serbia-Montenegro is geared mainly towards collective ball sports, while individual disciplines such as swimming, athletics and gymnastics tend to be overlooked. 
 Serbia-Montenegro will be fielding teams in all the most popular ball sports, with the exception of handball. Basketball team captain Dejan Bodiroga, the best European basketball player for a number of years now, will carry the national flag in the opening ceremony. 
 In volleyball, the fiercest opponents are likely to be Brazil and Italy; in water polo, Serbia-Montenegro and neighbouring Hungary will continue their traditional rivalry. In football, it is hard to guess what will happen. 
 The Olympics are not considered a major competition for footballers, and teams are made up of players under 23. 
 The monastery's spokesman, Father Syncellus Sava Janjic, said the move was extremely significant. 
  Financial Expectations High for the Olympics  12/08/2004 Forecasts of the financial and related benefits from the Athens Olympics appear somewhat rosy when compared to the data from past Games.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 12/08/04 Greece's Olympic Committee has set high standards for the Athens Games, raising expectations that they will generate a massive wave of tourism and constitute the most financially profitable event of the last two decades. 
 According to Bath University's Evangelia Kasimati, however, overall profits from the Sydney Olympics four years ago reached a more modest 5.9 billion euros. 
 The projected figures for Athens 2004 are linked to expectations that the Games will spur an unprecedented tourist boom. 
 While the Centre for Planning and Economic Research has suggested 300,400 new Olympic-related jobs would become available between now and 2010, the Athens 2004 Organising Committee tallies the number of actual Olympic-related jobs in 2003 and 2004 at 40,000. 
 Although the financial projections for Athens 2004 may turn out to have been overly optimistic, Greeks are nevertheless thrilled that the Games have come back to their original location. 
 During a visit to Bucharest at the end of June, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen emphasised that, in its capacity as a future EU member country, Romania must observe the procedures concerning the introduction of visa requirements for non-member states. 
 In addition, tourist agencies in Bulgaria are unhappy with the transit fees levied on visitors from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia who cross Romania to reach Bulgaria's Black Sea resorts. 
  Olympic Games Open in Athens  16/08/2004 A spectacular opening ceremony in Athens marked the start of the 28th Olympiad and the return of the Games to their place of origin. 
 Modern technology conveyed the history of Greek civilisation and a message of hope for the future.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens � 16/08/04 The world's greatest sporting event received a warm welcome home on Friday (13 August) as a crowd of 72,000 filled the Athens Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony of the 28th Olympiad. 
 Immediately after the parade, the Icelandic singer Bjork performed "Oceania". 
 In the shade of an olive tree, Athens 2004 Organising Committee chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki and the president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, welcomed the athletes. 
 A deal is expected to be reached by the end of 2004, paving the way for the opening of the SEE electricity and gas markets between 2005 and 2007 and the integration of the region's energy sector into the EU internal energy market. 
 The talks build on the political commitments underlying the Athens memoranda of understanding signed in November 2002 and December 2003. 
 In response, the government plans to introduce wide-ranging reforms.   Analysis by Athanassios Papandropoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 17/08/04 After seven long years of dust and delays, the Athens 2004 opening ceremony was held Friday (13 August) to widespread acclaim. 
 The prospect of national humiliation convinced the government to take drastic measures: it appointed Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki as head of the Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC). 
 For sheer tenacity, "Mrs A" would have given Sisyphus a run for his money. 
 Nevertheless, Athens managed to finish its Olympic projects, even as athletes, officials and journalists began to arrive at Eleftherios Venizelos Airport. 
 IOC President Jacques Rogge has expressed confidence that Athens will host "a magical Games". 
 Such a strategy should entail a wide range of economic and legislative reforms aimed at increasing growth and development capacity while maintaining firm policies that will safeguard long-term fiscal balance. 
 On 22 July, the country's newly launched high speed rail service met with disaster when an Ankara-bound train carrying 234 passengers derailed near the northern town of Sakarya, around 100km from the site of the latest accident. 
  Albania Modernises its Largest Seaport  19/08/2004 Albania's largest port, Durres, handles nearly 50 per cent of the country's imports and exports, and has also been designated the starting point for the pan-European Transport Corridor 8.

  Bulgarian Authorities Target Tax Evasion  24/08/2004 The average monthly income in Bulgaria is only 100 euros, yet Sofia and other cities are home to trendy cars and luxurious villas. 
 Officials set out to inspect all real estate worth more than 50,000 euros and all luxury cars worth over 30,000 euros. 
 One reason for such opacity may be the presence of corruption among the tax authorities themselves. 
 In addition, the UNHCR is recommending that people in especially vulnerable situations -- for example, people with severe disabilities, some categories of elderly people, and separated children -- should not be made to return, given the inadequate standards of health care and social welfare situations available in Kosovo. 
 As a result, athletes from Serbia-Montenegro are once again honouring the old Communist anthem, "Hey Slavs", as they receive medals at the Athens Olympics. 
 "An accession date should not be set because it could create false expectations and risk compromising careful preparation to an artificial, politically loaded timetable," the report said.

  Economic Plights Drive Prostitution in Turkey  27/08/2004 Research conducted by the Ankara Chamber of Commerce has lifted the veil on a growing problem in Turkey -- the spread of prostitution due to the country's economic troubles.   By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 27/08/04 Though prostitution is legal in Turkey, most of the women working in the industry are not registered and many are forced to ply their trade against their will, according to a new study conducted by the Ankara Chamber of Commerce (ATO). 
 The research found that prostitution is spreading in Turkey due to economic troubles. 
 Many are unable to gain employment in a registered brothel and end up working on the streets, researchers said. 
 Furthermore, researchers noted, there has been an influx of sex workers from Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Belarus. 
 At a press conference unveiling the research, ATO Chairman Sinan Aygun said that the rise in the sex trade is in part due to a decade of lax administration, combined with widespread poverty. 
 The 2004 Athens Olympics concluded Sunday (29 August) night with a spectacular ceremony under moonlit skies. 
 The head of the Athens 2004 Organising Committee, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, expressed pride in the Games, which returned to their home country after more than a century since the first modern Olympiad in 1896. 
 As the ceremony came to a close, the Olympic flag was lowered and Athens Mayor Dora Bakoayanni handed it over to Wang Qishan, the mayor of Beijing, which will host the next Summer Olympics in 2008. 
 According to a survey conducted by the Alpha Research polling agency earlier this year, 40 per cent of Bulgarians have a favourable attitude towards BSP leader Sergey Stanishev.

  Greece Considers Future of Olympic Sports Facilities  01/09/2004 Maintaining the sports facilities built for the 2004 Athens Olympics will cost tens of millions of euros annually. 
 Days after the end of the Athens Olympics, Greek authorities are mulling over the best possible future use for some of the venues and facilities built for the Games. 
 The Olympic village, for instance, will be turned into apartments for low-income workers, while the media and broadcast centres will be used as exhibition and conference halls. 
 Other options that are being discussed, according to the  International Herald Tribune , include finding private buyers for facilities such as stadiums and others, renewing Athens's bid to bring the Games permanently to their home country, and organising -- independently from the IOC -- Greece's own Olympics, to be held biannually in years not conflicting with IOC Games. 
  High Prices Squeeze Greek Consumers  02/09/2004 With consumer prices on the rise, Athens is steadily climbing the list of the world's most expensive cities. 
 The government favours a market-based approach to the issue.   By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 02/09/04 Greek consumers are paying more for goods and services, due to a wave of Olympics-related price hikes. 
 International research companies rank Athens as the 17th most expensive city in the world, with some basic services -- a cup of coffee, for example -- costing more than in New York or Sydney. 
 At 261 euros, the average cost of an Athens hotel room is the seventh highest worldwide, after London, Paris, New York, Geneva, Tokyo and Tel Aviv. 
 Moreover, Athens ranks among the five costliest cities in relation to local wages. 
 Meanwhile, experts at the economy ministry insist that the market should be able to correct itself, as consumers respond to lower buying capacity by limiting their spending. 
 However, Greece is also experiencing slumps in demand due to scarcity of tourists and the unwillingness of foreign enterprises to choose Greece as a base of operations. 
 The event has come a long way since its inception in 1995, when viewers saw 37 films in a city still under siege from Bosnian Serb units in the surrounding mountains. 
 Also briefly attending the film festival was Bosnian-born director Danis Tanovic, who has been credited for helping kick-start Bosnia and Herzegovina�s film industry with his black comedy about the 1992-1995 conflict, "No Man's Land", which won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2001. 
 He will also visit Diyarbakir, the main city in the country's predominantly Kurdish southeast, and meet with local leaders and NGO representatives. 
 The trial is widely seen as a test of Serbia-Montenegro's ability to handle war crimes cases.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 03/09/04 A new round in the trial of 17 men accused of war crimes at the Ovcara farm near Vukovar in 1991 began this week at the regional court in Belgrade. 
 Hundreds of men were transported from the city's hospital to the Ovcara site. 
 World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia Shigeo Katsu said one of the purposes of the conference was to assess the progress achieved over the past 12 months in four priority areas: education, employment, conflict prevention and resolution, and risky behaviours and HIV/AIDS. 
 We might decide to create a loose network of youth representatives with a shared agenda or agree to take joint action on specific advocacy goals, but, whatever the outcome, we should all strive for specificity", Katsu said. 
 The AKP garnered 362 out of 550 parliamentary seats and established Turkey's first one-party government in decades.

 Berisha declared that for "security reasons" he has formatted all the computers and shredded the paperwork of experts who participated in the evaluation. 
 At worst, seafarers died when malfunctions resulted in explosions or other catastrophes. 
 In August, a roundtable organised by the Seafarer�s Union of Croatia was held in Rijeka. 
 One of the speakers was Tatjana Krilic, the principal inspector for maritime safety at the Croatian Ministry of Sea, Tourism, Transport and Development. 
 Authorities have pledged that new technical standards will be in place soon, and that Croatia -- which boasts some of the world's most beautiful seas -- will become known for better-quality ships. 
  World Media Pleasantly Surprised by Athens Olympics  09/09/2004 Greece, the smallest country ever to host an Olympics, staged the event to widespread acclaim.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 09/09/04 The countdown for the 12th Paralympics starts Thursday (9 September) in Athens with the lighting of the flame at the ancient temple of Hephaestus. 
 The flame will then be carried in a relay across Attica, covering a distance of 410km until the culminating ceremony at the Olympic Stadium on 17 September. 
 "One month after, I thought I had visited the wrong city.

  Turkey Aims to Regulate Credit Cards  14/09/2004 Credit card use is on the rise in Turkey, and so is the amount of credit card debt. 
 Concerned about balance-of-payment difficulties, the government is seeking to impose regulations.  By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 14/09/04 An increase in the number of credit card transactions and credit card debtors is generating concern among Turkish authorities. 
 According to figures from the Central Bank, credit card transaction volume increased to 5.6 billion euros in August, while unpaid credit card debt stood at 233.2m euros. 
 A report prepared by the Ankara Chamber of Commerce shows that the number of credit card holders reached 23.2 million in Turkey, a country with a population of 68 million. 
 The increase in credit card transactions is worrisome to the government because of the potential for balance-of-payment difficulties. 
 The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency has prepared a draft law to get the credit card system in order. 
 The legislation would require banks to set credit limits based on a user's financial situation, while procedures and conditions for issuing credit cards would be determined by market conditions and international standards. 
 However, the Turkish Union of Banks (TBB) has called on the government to take a "sensitive" approach, stressing that credit cards contribute to the economy. 
 During an interview with local television, TBB head Ersin Ozince said placing any limitation on credit cards would be wrong. 
  OHR Official Urges BiH Politicians to Change Approach   15/09/2004 A senior international official in Bosnia and Herzegovina is urging local politicians to change their overall approach so that the project of transforming the country can be carried out successfully.  (Office of the High Representative, Fena - 14/09/04) 
 Such "agents of change" are vital to carrying out the difficult, but necessary reforms that will ensure a better future for the country, Hays said at a conference in Sarajevo. 
 Macedonian voters will be answering yes or no to the referendum question: "Do you favour local self-government territorial organisation (municipalities and the City of Skopje) as defined in the Law on Territorial Organisation of the Republic of Macedonia and Definition of Areas of Local Self-Government Units issued in 1996 and the Law on the City of Skopje issued the same year?" 
  One in Three Greeks Uses the Internet   16/09/2004 New research shows a steady increase in Internet use in Greece. 
 There is still a long way to go to reach the European average, however, and the content market is lagging.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens � 16/09/04 One in three Greeks now uses Internet services, and at least one in two uses personal computers, according to a study conducted by Focus WebID from February to March. 
 Researchers found a steady but incremental rise in Internet activity, with 32 per cent of Greeks between the ages of 13 and 70 now using the web. 
 Computers in general are used by 45 per cent of the population between 13 and 70, and by as many as 70 per cent of young people, the highly educated and well off. 
 The new research confirms previous findings that showed a gradual upward movement and predicted that Internet penetration in Greece would surpass 35 per cent during 2004. 
 Research also shows that Internet use remains primarily associated with offices and educational institutions, in large part because home computer use remains limited. 
 The relative scarcity of Greek-based sites in the top rankings suggests the content market also lags behind the European norm. 
 With the ruling coalition still reeling from its poor showing in the recent presidential vote, a repeat failure could shake up the government of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.  By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 17/09/04 Serbia will hold yet another election on 19 September to choose members of local assemblies as well as mayors of major cities. 
 Belgrade�s mayoral race is of special interest, as the capital accounts for a quarter of the country's population and GDP. 
 Calling on Matijasevic to "create a political structure serving citizens and their needs, and also to create material pre-requisites for all tasks ahead of him," Mikerevic urged him to carry out necessary reforms within his ministry as soon as possible. 
 DS candidate Nenad Bogdanovic won around 33 per cent of the vote in the race for mayor of Belgrade, followed by Aleksandar Vucic of the SRS, who received about 29 per cent. 
 The city council election results were similar. 
 Out of 90 seats, it is estimated that the DS will get 34, SRS 27, DSS 13 and the other parties 16. 
 I am convinced that Belgraders will not vote for an isolated Belgrade in the second round, as the city hall elections have also resulted in a convincing majority of democratic forces," Bogdanovic said. 
  Poll Provides Look at Bulgarian Attitudes   20/09/2004 The Bulgarian government enters the fall political season with increased public support. 
  Greek Economy Faces Cost Burden After Games  20/09/2004 Greece is grappling with the economic aftermath of the Olympics, including a massive public debt.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens � 20/09/04 The cost of the Olympics, combined with previously existing budgetary and economic problems, has left Greece with a considerable burden. 
 One much-discussed way of doing this is through the privatisation of large public organisations, such as the phone company, the water company, and electricity provider. 
 "We hope that in the country report to be issued on 6 October, Romania will be deemed a functioning market economy with the mention that, if reforms continue, it would have the full capacity of functioning within the conditions of the EU internal market upon the date of its EU entry," Puscas said in a press statement. 
 Compliance with the second -- the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union -- would only be required by 2007, he added. 
  Rail Line to Reconnect Former Yugoslav Republics  21/09/2004 In a move seen as highly significant for regional economic development, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia have agreed to launch a direct cargo train service among their capitals.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 21/09/04 The heads of the Serbian, Slovenian and Croatian railroads signed an agreement last month in Belgrade to introduce a direct cargo train, Sava Ekspres, which will run once a week among Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana. 
 Slovenia and Croatia are among the countries taking an active part in the privatisation of Serbian companies, and the cargo train is expected to transport large quantities of goods. 
 Two other cargo trains may be introduced six months later, he added. 
 Slovenian railroad Director Blaz Miklasic, meanwhile, said the introduction of daily cargo trains could be on the agenda of talks next year. 
 In particular, the bank will grant funds in April 2005 for the construction of a new thermo-central facility in the southern city of Vlora. 
 The UN agency, which has spent over $500m on programmes aimed at fostering refugee returns since 1995, said the international community's assistance in BiH's reconstruction would be essential for tackling problems such as repair of infrastructure and housing, job creation, and improving healthcare and education. 
 Annan suggested that the UN would consider further areas of responsibility that could be transferred to the provisional institutions, but added that "a more coherent capacity-building policy" would be essential. 
 "It is essential that all sections of the community should be represented in the new parliament that will be elected on 23 October," Passy said in a telephone call to Kostunica. 
 Improved judicial funding and use of resources, including the computerisation of courts, is also a priority. 
 "The position of DSS on this issue is very clear, which means respect for the Constitution, respect for the Belgrade Agreement, for all deadlines and actions that need to be carried out within those deadlines," Aligrudic said. 
 According to official data, from 1998 to 2002, nearly 500 children disappeared from Athens' Aghia Varvara centre, an institution for the rehabilitation of young victims of human trafficking. 
  Serbia Steps up Hunt for Mladic  29/09/2004 Amid warnings that the international community is losing patience with Belgrade's lack of co-operation, Serbian authorities have reportedly launched a massive search operation for wartime Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic.  (Independent - 29/09/04; AP, Reuters, VOA, Radio B92, Tanjug - 28/09/04) 
 Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior Serbian security officer told AP on Tuesday (28 September) that a massive search operation for former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic was ongoing. 
 Police, however, would not confirm the search and said no unusual activities were registered that day. 
 Mladic reportedly owns a small house in the village of Bobova, about 20km from Valjevo, and is widely believed to stay there during the summer. 
 The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, has repeatedly insisted that Mladic is hiding in Serbia. 
 The British daily  Independent  reported Wednesday that Washington would also block Serbia's access to funding from international financial institutions. 
 Toxic waste has been implicated in a range of health problems -- including birth defects, lung disease and cancer -- with children being particularly vulnerable. 
 "Turkey is a strategically important country whose EU membership would have implications for foreign policy in a number of potentially unstable neighbouring regions such as the Mediterranean, Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia," the EC study said. 
 However, he said it came in an awkward political moment, given that UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte is scheduled to visit Belgrade in early October. 
 Other salaries above average are in the defence forces and in mandatory social security, followed by healthcare and social protection, the electrical utility, waterworks and natural gas, transportation and warehousing, mining, agriculture, hunting and forestry, education and other social sectors. 
 Grossman said he still believes Washington could support the trial of the four generals being held in Serbia, but that before that could happen, the four must report to The Hague. 
 To me, the city of Madrid is a symbol of many things - youth, home, family, friendship," the Bulgarian leader said as he accepted the award. 
  Reformist Wins Mayoral Vote in Belgrade  04/10/2004 Serbia's runoff local elections on Sunday ended in cliffhangers in two of the major races. 
 Pro-reform candidate Nenad Bogdanovic narrowly defeated his ultranationalist rival to become mayor of Belgrade, while the Radicals edged past the Democrats in Novi Sad.  By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 04/10/04 Democratic Party (DS) candidate Nenad Bogdanovic is set to become mayor of Belgrade after defeating the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party's (SRS) contender for the post in a runoff Sunday (3 October). 
 "There is no doubt in my mind that Belgrade will turn into a reborn city in the next four years. 
 In Serbia's second-largest city, Novi Sad, the race was even more dramatic. 
 A total of 2,322,687 registered voters had the opportunity to vote directly for their local mayor and for municipal councils and assemblies. 
 The mission's report, published Sunday, hailed the elections as marking progress towards democracy and rule of law, but also voiced concern about the low turnout and the dominance of ethnicity as a factor in the campaign. 
 In Republika Srpska, the Serb Democratic Party lost in some municipalities it had controlled before, but still won 37 mayoral races. 
  Basescu Enters Romanian Presidential Race  05/10/2004 Following the withdrawal of Theodor Stolojan from Romania's presidential campaign, the main opposition alliance has chosen Bucharest Mayor Traian Basescu to run against Prime Minister Adrian Nastase. 
 Basescu, the mayor of Bucharest, was nominated after the withdrawal of National Liberal Party (PNL) chairman and alliance co-chairman Theodor Stolojan from the race. 
 During local elections in June, Basescu humiliated the PSD candidate, Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana, in the mayoral race. 
 Saturday's countrywide local elections, in which voters chose new city councils and mayors in 142 municipalities, were the first since the war to be organised and funded by the local authorities. 
 They were also the first elections in which mayors were directly elected. 
 The Muslim Party of Democratic Action, the Croat Democratic Union and the Serb Democratic Party appeared poised to win in areas where they have ethnic majorities, although it appeared that the moderate Union of Independent Social Democrats would take power in Banja Luka, the largest Serb-majority city. 
 On Monday, he promised visiting UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte that he would take action to bring fugitive indictees -- around 20 of whom are thought to be hiding in Serbia-Montenegro -- to justice. 
  UN, EU, US Welcome Tadic's Call to Kosovo Serbs   07/10/2004 Serbian President Boris Tadic's call for Kosovo Serbs to participate in the province's 23 October parliamentary elections has won unequivocal support from UN, EU and US officials.

 In addition to clashes with the Turkish military, KONGRA-GEL has carried out assassinations of well-known personalities and attacks on diplomatic, consular, commercial and tourist missions abroad. 
  Greek President: Turkey Must Recognise Cyprus Before Joining EU  11/10/2004 Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos says official recognition of the Greek Cypriot-led government is one of the requirements Turkey must meet before it can join the Union.   (The Straits Times - 11/10/04; AFP, VOA, Athens News Agency - 10/10/04; Kathimerini - 08/10/04) 
 "It is a great shame that 15 years after the end of the Cold War in Europe, a 'Berlin Wall' still divides the Cypriot capital, Nicosia, separating the island's Christian and Muslim communities," said the leader of Greece's main opposition party PASOK, former Foreign Minister George Papandreou, in a commentary carried by the Singapore-based  Straits Times  on Monday. 
 "We're not professionals, and we can't pick up explosives and weapons and keep them at our houses," said Deputy Mayor Aco Tomic. 
  US Defence Secretary Visits Romanian Black Sea Airbase  12/10/2004 Romanian officials have taken US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on an inspection tour of a Black Sea military base which could become part of the Pentagon's plans for more flexible deployments. 
 US officials say a final decision is expected in 2005.  (Washington Post, The New York Times - 12/10/04; AP, Reuters, AFP, VOA, American Forces Press Service, Rompres - 11/10/04) 
 Kicking off a visit to Romania on Monday (11 October), US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited a Black Sea air base reportedly being considered for use by the US military. 
 Facilities in Bulgaria, he added, would likely be packaged with the two bases Romania is offering to forge a strong US presence in Eastern Europe. 
 Under the government's new initiative, customers will soon also be able to pay their telephone, power and water bills this way. 
  After Fiat Write-Off, Serbia's Sole Carmaker Struggles On  12/10/2004 Serbia's troubled car manufacturer Zastava finally received some good news in August when Italy's Fiat agreed to write off 72.5 per cent of its debt. 
 Even so, the future of the former Yugoslav industrial leader remains uncertain.  By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 12/10/04 Ever since the Yugo-America project failed in the late 1980s, plans have been devised to revamp Serbia's one-time industrial leader, carmaker Zastava. 
 With 4,500 workers who produced 13,500 cars in 2003, the company hopes that a foreign producer would at least agree to sell a platform to Zastava to develop its own model, if not let it manufacture a foreign model. 
 The bold plan presented earlier this year by Zastava's management stipulates a twofold increase in workforce and an output of 40,000 cars in the first year alone. 
 But he noted the outcome would depend on the country's success in implementing all aspects of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.  By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 13/10/04 During a visit to Macedonia on Monday (11 October) US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Washington would continue to assist the country in its efforts to join NATO. 
 Verheugen was speaking during a two-day trip to Croatia -- the last country he is visiting in his current capacity. 
 During a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte again urged Zagreb to detain Gotovina. 
 War crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who paid an official visit to Belgrade last week, said she has become more optimistic about prospects for co-operation. 
 During his recent visit to Skopje, US State Undersecretary for Political Affairs Marc Grossman said Washington is convinced that Macedonian citizens will choose the rapid path to EU and NATO membership. 
 It was the first time since the end of the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) that the Bosnian Serbs have acknowledged the scale of the killing in July 1995, viewed as the single worst atrocity in Europe since World War II. 
  Healthcare Computerisation Put on Hold in Croatia  15/10/2004 An ambitious project to computerise Croatia's healthcare system is in limbo, with the government calling for a financial review. 
 But advocates of the project are crying foul.  By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb � 15/09/04 More than three years ago, Croatia decided to computerise its healthcare system, especially in the area of primary care. 
 The entire project -- including computerisation of outpatient clinics, hospitals and institutes -- was expected to cost around 66.3m euros. 
 Croatia spends 1.8 billion euros on healthcare annually, and the investment in computerisation was seen as likely to result in significant savings over the long term. 
 "The cost of computerisation is minor in relation to the benefits," an official study concluded. 
 "Computerisation of primary health care, where most of all the expenditures in healthcare originate, will give us a complete insight into the expenditure, at the moment of its creation, which will considerably lower higher-level costs at polyclinics and hospitals." 
 Following the change of government in November 2003, however, nearly all healthcare projects initiated by the previous administration were suspended. 
 He has attacked his predecessor, Andro Vlahusic, for signing the computerisation contract just three days before leaving office. 
 The government also says there are compatibility problems among existing computer resources in hospitals, primary care sites and the state health insurance bureau. 
 Advocates of the computerisation project say the real reason is that the government neglected to earmark the necessary additional funding, even though it represents only a small part of the overall budget. 
 The project should not have been halted, said Dr Ranko Stevanovic, a former health ministry official who now heads the Department of Primary Healthcare at the Croatian Institute of Public Health. 
 "Besides this, there were also consultants from the World Bank and OSCE who evaluated the chosen solutions, while the best domestic experts in the area of computers, public healthcare institutions, health insurance, the medical association and faculty were engaged," Stevanovic added. 
 "More attention needs to be paid to the acquisition of the skills and values that the modern university graduate requires and expects to receive." 
 "It is hard to explain that in the same city, a school with a Bosnian curriculum can fulfil the preconditions for nine-year schooling, while another school with a Croat curriculum can not. 
  Southeast European Power Grid Reconnected with West  18/10/2004 For 13 years, the electricity networks of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia and Romania have been isolated from the rest of Europe. 
 That will change with the resumption of power transmissions between the two areas, set to begin on 1 November.  By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 18/10/04 The Croatian Electrical Utility Company (HEP) moved to reconnect Southeastern Europe's electricity grid with the rest of the continent earlier this month -- an event of great importance for the European electricity industry. 
 "This provides momentum for globalisation of the European electricity market and lifts supply safety to a higher level," HEP Chief Executive Ivan Mravak said on 11 October. 
 It will improve HEP's limited capacities for import and export of electricity, especially from countries where power is considerably cheaper than in Croatia. 
 The motion, signed by the two parties' 104 lawmakers in Serbia's 250-seat assembly, claimed the president overstepped his legal powers. 
 At least half of all registered voters, or about 3.25 million, would have to say "yes" for Tadic to be unseated. 
 We would win and get more seats than all the government parties together. 
 At the same time, we would have more seats than the allegedly always victorious Serbian Radical Party, which in truth cannot win anywhere alone." 
 A key topic at the meeting was improving the link between NATO's political decision to take on missions and ensuring the availability of the forces to carry them out. 
 According to the US Ambassador to NATO, Nicholas Burns, Washington would like to see the Alliance's 8,000-strong International Security and Assistance Force combined with the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom, which is fighting al Qaeda terrorists and remnants of the former Taliban regime. 
 Meanwhile, Russia said it would contribute to the Alliance's counter terrorism missions by providing two ships to NATO's guard mission in the Mediterranean Sea, known as Operation Active Endeavour. 
 Responding to a reporter's question on Tuesday on whether his statement implied that police would not be instructed to carry out the arrests, the justice minister suggested this would contradict the law. 
 This is just a search for a formal reason to delay the entire action," Milan Pasanski of the Forum for Terrorism and Violence in Politics told Radio B92. 
 "If arresting retired generals threatens national security, then this means that the country does not have the monopoly of power, rather someone else does," Human Rights Watch researcher Bogdan Ivanisevic told Radio B92, adding that the government appeared to be simply looking for arguments to justify its reluctance to take action against indicted war criminals.

 To address this problem, the Ribarstvo fish production and canning factory plans a series of projects designed to increase capacity ten fold. 
 Currently, he says, Montenegro is simply not capable of earning 1.5m euros annually through fish exports, and some fishermen have purchased expensive boats only to find the amount of fish available isn't enough to turn a profit.

 However, Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro continue to disagree over who has jurisdiction.  By Jelena Tusup for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 10/02/05 UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte has proposed that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) transfer the trial of three former Yugoslav Army generals either to Croatia or Serbia-Montenegro. 
 An upcoming report by UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte is expected to strongly influence the EU's decision on proceeding.

 The cost of the project, about 28m euros, will come mainly from foreign sources, including a credit from the EBRD and a grant from the EU's PHARE programme, as well as from Bucharest's mayoral budget. 
 According to municipal officials, the reconstruction aims to "recreate the former aspect of the area, but with modern facilities", conserving the city's archeological and architectural heritage while spurring the restoration of privately owned buildings.

 Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel will reportedly brief Bush about the situation in the Balkans, with the goal of obtaining Washington's continued support for the Union's policy in the region. 
 Former Serbian Minister of Foreign Affairs Goran Svilanovic -- who is a staunch supporter of extraditions to The Hague -- said Washington's decision is a sharp reminder that international obligations must be fulfilled. 
 In a letter to the EU presidency last week, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said authorities "simply have not done everything in their power" to capture him.

 Some organisations are attempting to stem the tide by providing scholarships.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 22/02/05 According to the latest research conducted by the Centre for Alternative Studies, young people in Serbia face a series of difficulties, including unemployment, low wages, housing shortages, a worrisome economic outlook and obstacles to career development. 
 In the past, around 300,000 young people left Serbia each year, including about 8 per cent of the top university students. 
 In a bid to slow this trend, university students have established the Association of Serbia's Best Students, which helps young people obtain scholarships. 
 Another organisation, the Centre for Child Care, awarded 73 scholarships last year, with only two recipients later choosing to leave the country. 
 Although she loves her city and her friends, Zecevic says, "Unless the climate changes, I will be forced to leave." 
 Another sociologist, Smiljka Tomanovic, has done extensive research into the situation of young people. 
 As a result, many young people evolve a strategy of postponement, delaying everything from university studies to finding a job, getting married and having children. 
 Surveys have found that 77 per cent of unmarried young men and women live with their parents, and even those who do get married are likely to become part of extended parental family structures -- which, researchers say, are frequently burdened by conflicts and even violence. 
 Research into these issues is hampered by apathy and lack of funding, Tomanovic says, adding that she hopes the recent survey results will "inspire those who hold power in society to drop down from the ideological level to the practical level of doing something for young people". 
 Furthermore, a simple qualified majority could also postpone Romania's accession, if Bucharest fails to carry out judicial reform, restructuring of internal markets and other commitments. 
 It also reportedly plans to close one of its five production facilities, slash its research and development expenses by 50 per cent, and finance a smaller number of projects in the future. 
 According to the ICTY, El-Mujahid fighters "indiscriminately opened gunfire" on a group of Bosnian Croat prisoners captured after an attack on the village of Maline in the Travnik municipality. 
 In September 1995, during the ARBiH�s 3rd and 2nd Corps operation to liberate Vozuca village, the El-Mujahid unit was deployed behind enemy lines and committed violent acts against Bosnian Serb civilians as well as war prisoners. 
 According to the National Programme for Joining the European Union (NPPEU), most of the money spent during the next few years will be invested in education and research. 
 While pre-membership funds will be used to carry out the tasks Croatia must fulfil during the accession process, EU structural funds will become available after the country joins. 
 EU assistance to Croatia -- channeled mainly through the CARDS programme -- has so far focused on democratic stabilisation, including the return of refugees and displaced persons, economic and social development, justice and home affairs, building administrative capacity, environmental protection and boosting regional co-operation. 
 This assessment will be carried out with the help of the EU. 
 Over the next 12 days, 380 candidates who hope to win the mayor's office in 85 municipalities will present their platforms to voters.

  Alleged Accomplice in Djindjic Murder Could Lead to Organisers  28/02/2005 Greece recently extradited Dejan "Bugsy" Milenkovic, the driver of a truck that attempted to hit Zoran Djindjic's car in an assassination attempt in February 2003. 
 Nicknamed for the notorious criminal Bugsy Siegel, he is thought to have been a key member of the Zemun Clan criminal gang, whose members allegedly carried out the attack on Djindjic. 
 They say he was behind the wheel of a truck that attempted to hit Djindjic's car on a Belgrade highway on 21 February 2003. 
 Other members of the Zemun gang were then allegedly supposed to fire a rocket into the car, but the plan failed because Milenkovic did not manage to stop Djindjic's vehicle. 
 While stepping up efforts to locate and apprehend him, Croatian authorities insist the information they have gathered suggests Gotovina is not in the country -- a claim which chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte refutes. 
 With EU membership expected in 2007, officials are taking steps to rectify these problems.  By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 01/03/05 Almost a year ago Romanian officials discovered 404 barrels containing more than 100 tonnes of vinyl polychloride in a farmyard in Felnac, a village near the border with Hungary. 
 The barrels were sealed, and months later, exported back to France.

  New Agreement Establishes Integration Curriculum in Albania   03/03/2005 Albania's Ministry of Integration and the University of Tirana have signed a co-operation agreement on joint steps needed to accelerate the country's EU integration process. 
 University programmes will seek to boost awareness of the challenges Albania faces.  By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 03/03/05 Albania's Ministry of Integration has signed an agreement with the University of Tirana on an initiative to boost the country's bid for EU membership. 
 Together, the ministry and the university will work to teach and cultivate European values. 
 In addition, a master's programme in European Studies will be consolidated at the university. 
 European Integration Minister Ermelinda Meksi and University of Tirana Chancellor Shezai Rokaj signed the document last month. 
 "The integration ministry will offer its contribution to the university by implementing joint programmes and assistance, while the university will prepare future professionals who can work or assist the ministry with their expertise on Albania's European integration," Rokaj said. 
 Currently, several university faculties teach European integration in fields such as human sciences, history, philology and economics. 
 The agreement with the University of Tirana is part of an overall information and communications strategy the government is implementing to ensure transparency in the integration process. 
 According to chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, at least a dozen of them are in Serbia. 
 Earlier this month, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte told Austrian TV that Serbian authorities have, for the first time, acknowledged that Mladic is on Serbian territory. 
 Rehn, however, and most other European officials appear to agree with chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who told the EU last month that Gotovina was within reach. 
 In a telephone interview with the Croatian news agency HINA, del Ponte's spokeswoman suggested that the prosecutor could hardly be expected to certify that Croatia has met that condition without Gotovina in the dock.

  Record Prices for Romanian Real Estate  21/03/2005 Economic growth, foreign investors, a rise in the exchange rate of the leu, and the prospect of EU accession have contributed to an unprecedented boom in Romania's real estate market.  By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 21/03/05 George Dumitrescu owns a three-room apartment in a typical communist-era apartment block in Bucharest -- eight floors with six flats each, dark hallways, a scary elevator, an inefficient heating system and small rooms.

  Race for Bucharest Mayor Nears Finish Line  30/03/2005 With the election only days away, the race to become the next mayor of Bucharest is heating up. 
 The winner will succeed Traian Basescu, who stepped down in December to become president.  By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 30/03/05 Bucharest will soon have its fourth general mayor in less than nine years. 
 Interim mayor Viorel Lis remained in power after the 1998 elections, but lost in 2000 to Traian Basescu. 
 Opinion polls suggest that Sunday's (3 April) vote will primarily be a contest between Adriean Videanu, the candidate of the ruling Justice and Truth (DA) Alliance -- composed of the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democrat Party (PD) -- and Marian Vanghelie, the representative of the former ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) and mayor of Bucharest's 5th district. 
 "The general mayoralty is not too much for me, no matter what my opponents say," Vanghelie insists. 
 As chief inspector in the 6th district mayoralty, he became known for visiting Bucharest's markets in search of expired food or merchants selling goods by short weight. 
 Among the most important projects the city has inherited from Basescu are modernising the road and tram infrastructure and rehabilitating the historic centre. 
 Polls show that most residents place a high priority on improving the condition of the streets and the city's cleanliness. 
 Officials caution, however, that adequate preparations must be made to avoid another failure.  (FT, Turkish Daily News - 31/03/05; Reuters, NTV MSNBC, Dunya, Cyprus News Agency, EurActiv, EUobserver - 30/03/05; AFP, Athens News Agency, Cyprus News Agency - 29/03/05) 
  OSCE Urges BiH Courts to Enhance Capacity for War Crimes Trials  31/03/2005 While courts and prosecutors in Bosnia and Herzegovina have made conscientious efforts to bring accused war criminals to justice, a number of obstacles to effective domestic prosecution of cases remain, according to a new OSCE report.

 "Little Manhattan" is just one of several initiatives city officials are undertaking in a bid to give a new look to the capital. 
 Belgrade Mayor Nenad Bogdanovic recently signed a pre-contract with the EBRD on financing the 110m-euro project, which is meant to significantly improve the capital's traffic infrastructure. 
 EBRD Deputy Director Henry Russell has said his organisation is ready to invest between 50m and 75m euros; the rest would come from city coffers. 
 Also under way is the revamping of the city's urban rail system -- the central factor in any consideration of Belgrade's traffic situation.

 Authorities say the programme is producing results, but some critics charge the programme is intrusive and does not tackle the most serious types of crime.  By Vassilis Vassiliou for Southeast European Times in Athens � 01/04/2005 An unprecedented anti-crime effort known as the POLIS project is now under way in Greece. 
 As a result of the random identity checks and body searches, 1,407 people were arrested for 9,116 violations of the law. 
 As for the random checks, Voudouris says the POLIS project is intended to tackle low-level crime by arresting those who are carry illegal objects such as drugs, fake products and weapons, or who drive stolen vehicles. 
 Most are habitual users who roam the cities in search of a quick fix. 
 More than 150 persons have been arrested, wanted for evading debts to the state, while 100 other detainees were illegal immigrants who either had no green card or were carrying a forged one. 
 At 58, he also became the youngest cardinal to be elected pope in 132 years.

 In addition, Bulgaria and Croatia have a more limited role as destination countries, with women being channeled to resort areas during the tourist season, while Serbia-Montenegro is also a source country. 
 But law enforcement remains erratic and resources scarce, and the country's laws -- while covering crimes such as abduction and rape -- do not explicitly prohibit trafficking. 
 Montenegro, meanwhile, was the site of a major scandal in 2004 involving allegations of high-level complicity in the sex trade. 
  US Embassy "Scorecard" Tracks Progress of Court Cases  06/04/2005 The US Embassy in Skopje has released a scorecard recording progress in cases being heard in Macedonian courts.   By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje � 06/04/05 Last month, the US Embassy published a scorecard which tracks more than ten cases being tried before Macedonian courts. 
 "The scorecard will be updated depending on whether there are cases in the future that stand long pending a ruling," Butler said. 
 "We are not preparing a hit list of judges," says Catherine Shallow, a spokesperson for the US State Department European Bureau."The embassy in Skopje is working on a project for monitoring the cases of corruption and we are expecting that a product of the project will be the so-called scorecard that documents for how long those cases are stuck in the judiciary pending resolution," she told the Voice of America. 
 "The scorecard is not meant in all instances to be critical of prosecutors, defence attorneys, or judges," the statement says, adding that "in some instances, the presiding judge was recently assigned to the case after previous judges failed to handle it properly or were refused for various reasons. 
 But it also cautioned that the country might need to take additional measures.  (FT - 07/04/05; EU, AFP, AP, Dow Jones, Athens News Agency, Macedonian Press Agency - 06/04/05; FT - 01/04/05)

  Turkey More Competitive Than Greece in Tourism  11/04/2005 The tourism industry in the Balkans is picking up, with the Turkish coasts of the Aegean Sea making big progress in attracting tourists, due to lower costs and stepped-up advertising.  By Vassilis Vassiliou for Southeast European Times in Athens � 11/04/05 As the summer fast approaches, people in the tourism industry are preparing for their big season. 
 Although Greece received overwhelming media attention last year during the Olympics in Athens, and the government quadrupled the advertising budget for tourism from 7.5m euros to 30m euros, the growth of tourism has been less than expected.

  Ship Owners Increase Fleet Sizes in Greece  12/04/2005 More than $20m is coming into the coffers of shipowners in Greece every day, most of which is being invested in building new ships that will be cheaper to run from Piraeus.  By Vassilis Vassiliou for Southeast European Times in Athens � 12/04/05 The Greek shipping industry is developing at a healthy pace. 
 The majority of orders were for tankers and bulk carriers, the markets that the Greeks are more prone to service, leaving out ships for niche markets like vehicle carriers, refrigerator vessels or multi-purpose ships. 
 The aim of the European Commission (EC) is to build the infrastructure for a pan-European network of sea transport at the port that will compete, in terms of time and cost, with terrestrial transferring of goods. 
  Greece, Turkey Announce New Confidence-Building Measures  13/04/2005 Greece and Turkey announced new measures to boost bilateral confidence and defuse tension resulting from mutual allegations of air space violations over the Aegean Sea.  (AFP, VOA, Turkish Press, Athens News Agency, The Hellenic Radio, Macedonian Press Agency, NTV MSNBC - 12/04/05)

  Greece to Privatise Public Organisations   25/04/2005 As it seeks to raise revenue, the Greek government is planning to sell its stake in many organisations, with an emphasis on the transport and gambling industries.  By Vassilis Vassiliou for Southeast European Times in Athens � 25/04/05 Facing serious budgetary problems, the Greek government is looking for new ways to boost revenues, including through privatisation of state-owned concerns.

 The government is also considering the sale of 25 per cent of the Athens International Airport. 
 Piraeus is the busiest port in Europe for liner shipping, with 101 million passengers yearly, and will upgrade its loading mechanisms to increase its capacity for commercial shipping. 
 In the meantime, the government is likely to move forward to fully privatise the largest casino in the country -- Mont Parnes, north of Athens. 
 By that time, authorities estimate, 90 per cent of municipalities will have shown they have management capacity, enabling them to receive funds from block subsidies.

  Bulgaria, Greece, Russia Sign Deal for Major Pipeline Project  02/05/2005 Bulgaria, Greece and Russia have agreed to build a new trans-Balkan oil pipeline, which is expected to ease the pressure on the Bosporus when it starts operating in 2008.  (Sofia News Agency, RIA Novosti - 15/04/05; AP, FT, BBC, AFX, VOA, BTA, Sofia News Agency, Athens News Agency, Macedonian Press Agency, Pravda, Bulgarian Government Web site - 12/04/05) 
 The 522m-euro deal envisions the construction of a 285km pipeline that will carry Caspian crude oil from the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Bourgas to Alexandroupolis, on Greece's Aegean coast. 
 The oil will be loaded at the Russian port of Novorossiysk and delivered via the Black Sea to Bourgas, where Bulgaria will build a 50m-tonne storage facility. 
 The pipeline will have a capacity of 700,000 barrels per day. 
 The planned annual capacity for the initial stage of the project is 15m tonnes. 
 Other partners, according to the media, include Greece's Hellenic Petroleum, US Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Russia's Lukoil and Rosneft, and Bulgaria's Technoexportstroy. 
 Most of the EUFOR operations are carried out in close conjunction with local law enforcement agencies. 
  Romanian Programme Targets Older Vehicles   03/05/2005 Cars on the road in Romania have an average age of 13.5 years, and many fall short of Western safety and emissions standards. 
 Authorities have launched a national programme to encourage residents to upgrade to newer vehicles, but critics say more is needed to comply with EU rules.  By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 03/05/05 Almost one half of the 3.8 million cars registered in Romania were produced more than 12 years ago. 
 Some of the older cars are imports brought in from Western Europe after the end of the communist era, but these are often not well maintained. 
 About 350,000 cars on the road are more than 20 years old. 
 "The average age of the cars in circulation is 13.5 years. 
 Under a scrappage programme launched by the ministry, owners of cars that are more than 12 years old can turn them in to scrap iron collectors in exchange for 930 euros. 
 That money can be only used as a deposit on a new car. 
 The deposit money it provides is nowhere near the amount needed to buy a new car -- the cheapest of which costs more than 4,000 euros. 
 Some have turned to selling their older cars to individuals who then exploit the government programme. 
 The result has been a significant increase in the prices of old cars. 
 Critics of the programme say it uses public money to boost new car sales, rather than creating a modern system of waste recovery and recycling that Romania lacks. 
 Only 12m euros were allocated, which means that only about 14,000 old cars will be eliminated this year -- less than 1 per cent of targeted vehicles. 
 The Cernavoda plant's 705-megawatt, Canadian-designed Unit 1 began operating in December 1996 and currently meets more than 10 per cent of Romania's electricity needs. 
 A second unit with the same capacity, also of the so-called CANDU type, is under construction with completion expected in 2007. 
 "The operations were carried out in co-ordination with SECI Centre for Combating Cross-border Crime," Pavlovski said. 
 It is also expected to boost cargo traffic along the Belgrade-Sofia-Istanbul route. 
 Bulgarian and Serbian experts anticipate a considerable increase in cargo traffic along the Belgrade-Sofia-Istanbul route of Pan-European Corridor 10 as a result of simplifying border control procedures. 
 Officials in Sofia also believe that the number of foreign tourists traveling by train to the Bulgarian Black Sea resorts is likely to grow. 
  Romanian Car Market Is Booming   06/05/2005 In the first quarter of this year, Romanian car dealers sold more vehicles than ever before. 
 More than 56,000 vehicles (about 48,300 cars and 8,000 commercial vehicles) were sold in Romania in the first quarter of the year, at a total of 600m euros. 
 About 32,000 of these cars were locally produced brands -- including more than 24,000 Dacias, a 128 per cent increase from 2004. 
 The 10 per cent appreciation of the national currency exchange rate to the euro and US dollar made cars more affordable too, as their prices are fixed in foreign currencies. 
 Dacia sales were helped by the launch of the new Logan model, manufactured by the Dacia Renault factory in Pitesti, a city of 150,000 people. 
 Local factories, which produced 26,500 cars from January to March 2004, registered an 82 per cent rise in production during the same period this year. 
 There are too many clients for a limited number of personnel and showrooms, as well as a limited number of cars. 
 "When the sales over-run the forecast up to 20 per cent, it is not a problem, but if the difference reaches 40 per cent or even 50 per cent, the delivery time for a car might be longer than 30 days," said Radu Cristian, commercial manager of Peugeot dealer Trust Motors. 
 The expert discussions that have taken place since then have focused on everyday issues in three areas -- missing people, the return of those displaced in the 1998-1999 conflict, and electricity. 
  Turkey Prepares for 2005 Tourist Season   09/05/2005 After surpassing projections last year, Turkish tourism is gearing up for what many expect will be another record-setting season in 2005.

 Explorations aimed at learning more about the observatory resume next month.  By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 11/05/05 Macedonia's Megalithic-era Kokino Observatory is located 1,030m above sea level on the Tativec Kamen Summit near Kumanovo. 
 Three research and documentation centres from Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia are planning to set up a permanent regional summer school. 
 The project is one of the results of co-operation between the HLC, the Sarajevo-based Research and Documentation Centre (IDC) and the Zagreb-based Documenta -- Centre for Dealing with the Past. 
 Although they use different methodologies, they all share the view that the establishment of truth, as a precondition of all forms of justice, requires a persistent search for facts. 
 It seems to me very important to determine what dealing with the past really means in the educational system of our respective countries, what is in our history textbooks, and how much factual truth can be found in them instead of rather dubious interpretations we most often find there," Terselic said. 
 As part of their new project, dubbed Summer School for Dealing with the Past, the three NGOs are organising one-week programmes for university students and NGO activists from the three countries. 
 The new releases are aimed at users who face a language barrier in using computers and the Internet, said Ilijanco Gagovski, Microsoft's director for Macedonia. 
 The number of people over 40 in Macedonia who speak English is thought to be small, and that could be why only between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of Macedonians use the Internet, although polls show the number of computer users is higher. 
 A licensing operation Microsoft conducted in 2004 found that only 8,000 licensed versions of its Windows software were being used in Macedonia, out of 100,000 computers.

 "The key topics all ministries have to insist on are the commitments related to the process of EU accession, preventing and fighting corruption, the absorption of European funds, the firm implementation of the set policies, the carrying out and finalisation of the programmes scheduled for this year, in line with the government programme," the government press office quoted Tariceanu as saying Sunday. 
 Besides tackling corruption and fraud, judicial reform is also among the measures Bulgaria is expected to carry out before joining the EU. 
  Cost of Bulgarian Parliamentary Elections Grows to 7.5M Euros   18/05/2005 The cost of the 25 June parliamentary elections in Bulgaria is expected to reach about 7.5m euros, exceeding by 2m euros the amount the Balkan country was initially planning to spend on the vote.

(Reuters - 26/05/05; Reuters, BBC, VOA, The Scotsman, Breakingnews.ie, Fena - 25/05/05) 
 "If we had information that Karadzic was hiding somewhere, it would be a different kind of operation," the spokesman told Reuters by telephone. 
 The searches, which are viewed as a new effort to step up the pressure on war crimes fugitives, follow several unsuccessful attempts by international troops in recent years to catch Karadzic.

 Citing surveys conducted by different polling groups in the recent weeks and months, Konstantinov said the coalition led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is likely to win about 104 parliamentary seats. 
 Two right-wing coalitions -- the United Democratic Forces and the Bulgarian People's Union (BPU) -- as well as the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB), could win a total of about 51 seats, though it is also possible that either the BPU or DSB might fail to pass the 4 per cent threshold, Konstantinov said. 
 According to its election platform, it would increase the budget allocations for education and healthcare to up to 5.8 per cent and 6 per cent of GDP, respectively, the Bulgarian News Agency reported Wednesday. 
 Konstantinov said there were indications that campaigning would be more respectful than in previous years, with the key players taking care not to alienate potential coalition partners.

 At the same time, seaside and mountain resorts present another type of problem -- open-air bars and discotheques that play loud music deep into the night, interfering with the sleep of nearby hotel guests. 
 Hoping to make the seaside more tourist-friendly, the environment ministry decided to order the removal of such establishments from the beachfronts, but then re-authorised some construction after officials realised that tourists need at least some beach-bars.

 The company hopes to draw tourists to the Black Sea coast, the Danube Delta, the Carpathian resorts and the historical regions of Maramures, Bucovina and Transylvania. 
 The season has shifted from 15 May to 15 September to 1 May to 1 September, and the results have been noticeable. 
 After 12 hours of debate, 62 lawmakers in the 83-seat RSNA voted against the police restructuring plan. 
 Kosovo's unresolved status created political insecurity, discouraged returns, fed extremist designs, scared off foreign investment and was not sustainable, he said. 
  Belgrade Shocked by Srebrenica Video, Arrests Alleged Executioners  03/06/2005 Serbian authorities have arrested former members of the Scorpions paramilitary unit following the release of a video that shows the 1995 executions of Muslim prisoners in Srebrenica.  By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 03/06/05 At a joint news conference Thursday (2 June) with visiting UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica announced that several people have been arrested for their alleged role in executing Muslim prisoners at Srebrenica in 1995. 
 Two prisoners are executed after first being ordered to carry the bodies of the others to a barn. 
 "Ismail Kadare is a writer who maps a whole culture -- its history, its passion, its folklore, its politics, its disasters," John Carey, chairman of the three-member panel of judges, said in a statement posted on the award's Web site Thursday. 
 Amnesty International urged the UN Security Council on Monday (6 June) to extend the mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and to provide the funding it needs to carry out its tasks. 
 "Thousands of people have yet to be tried for the war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed during the violent break-up of Yugoslavia," Amnesty International's director for Europe and Central Asia, Nicola Duckworth, said in a statement. 
 "We have motor boats, but the mayors in the flooded villages were not able to tell us where to intervene," says Marian Ghencea, the co-ordinator of Timisoara's disaster fighting department. 
 In Timis County, meanwhile, the Emergency Situations Inspectorate could offer only a few old paddleboats, having spent most of its money on a new computer network. 
 "The question of Ratko Mladic keeps popping up," Ljajic said following a visit to Washington, where he met with State Department and National Security Council officials. 
 At the beginning of the year, US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael C. Polt announced that Washington was suspending financial aid to Belgrade until co-operation improves. 
  BTC Pipeline Project Becomes a Reality   07/06/2005 A 1,768km pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan to the Turkish port of Ceyhan is expected to spur development, guarantee energy supplies and reduce dependence on Middle East oil.  By Allan Cove for Southeast European Times -- 07/06/05 A new pipeline which will carry 50 million tonnes of petrol yearly from Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan was officially opened at a ceremony last month. 
 The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline -- a $3.2 billion project with a capacity of 1 million barrels a day -- is the first direct oil link between the landlocked Caspian, which is thought to contain the world's third-largest oil and gas reserves, and the Mediterranean. 
 "The BTC pipeline opens up massive new fields in the Caspian Sea to world markets, enhancing security of supply for decades to come. 
 Stressing that "the status quo here is not sustainable", he said Washington's view is "that change has to come and that should come in 2005". 
 But its work won't be complete until all indictees -- including top fugitives Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Ante Gotovina -- have been brought to justice, says chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 09/06/05 During her most recent visit to Belgrade, UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte had words of praise for the government of Vojislav Kostunica, describing as "a brilliant action" the government's move to arrest former members of the Scorpions paramilitary unit following the release of a video showing the execution of Bosnian Muslims from Srebrenica. 
  Washington Releases Aid to Serbia-Montenegro, Expects Mladic's Arrest Soon  10/06/2005 War crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic may soon end up behind bars in The Hague, a senior US official said Thursday, while announcing the Bush Administration's decision to unblock $10m in aid to Serbia-Montenegro following its improved war crimes co-operation.  (International Herald Tribune, The Guardian, The Independent, VOA, Blic - 10/06/05; Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, CNN, Washington File, Radio B92, Serbian Government Web Site - 09/06/05) 
 While praising Belgrade for persuading the fugitives to surrender, Burns voiced Washington's hope that the authorities would take the "final steps" to deliver Mladic to the UN tribunal as well. 
 Both face counts of genocide for their alleged roles in the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica of up to 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys, the single worst atrocity in Europe since the end of World War II. 
 In Washington, meanwhile, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States expects all leaders in the region to arrest and transfer to The Hague the remaining fugitive indictees, including Karadzic and Croatia's Ante Gotovina. 
 Based on these results, the MBMD predicts the following distribution of seats in Bulgaria's next 240-seat assembly: 103 or 104 for the Coalition for Bulgaria, 63 or 64 for the NMS-II, 32 for the UtDF, 24 for the MRF and 16 for the BPU. 
  Greek Government Wins Confidence Vote   13/06/2005 Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis won a vote of confidence in the early hours of Monday, gaining parliamentary support for his government's social and economic reform plans.   (Reuters, Bloomberg, AFP, Athens News Agency - 13/06/05; The Hellenic Radio - 12/06/05; Athens News Agency, Macedonian Press Agency, Kathimerini - 11/06/05; Bloomberg - 10/06/05; Reuters - 08/06/05) 
 Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has easily won a parliamentary vote of confidence that will allow his government to carry out its social and economic reform plans. 
 Following three days of debate, all 165 lawmakers of the ruling conservative New Democracy (ND) party in Greece's 300-seat parliament voted in favour of the government in an open ballot held in the early hours of Monday (13 June). 
 A former sociology professor at Belgrade University, she has been a busy publicist, producing a vast number of newspaper columns and books, which -- during the regime's years in power -- were printed in mass quantities but enjoyed only modest sales. 
 "The implementation of standards is just one component and I will also carry out a wider evaluation of the state of things in Kosovo, as requested by [Annan]," Eide said in Pristina. 
 It emphasises that the province's future status must be based on multiethnicity, the protection of minorities and monuments of culture, and an efficient fight against organised crime. 
  Washington to Be Actively Engaged in Balkans in 2005, 2006  15/06/2005 Washington plans to be actively involved in diplomatic initiatives in 2005 and 2006 aimed at helping Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Serbia-Montenegro move forward, says US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns.   (US State Department, Reuters - 14/06/05) 
 In response to the improved co-operation, Washington last week resumed its assistance to Serbia-Montenegro, unblocking more than $10m in aid. 
 Washington supports the diplomatic process that could lead to final status talks by this autumn, he said. 
 The United States is planning to be very actively involved throughout the process, Burns said, adding that Washington's position is that the Serbian government, the Kosovo Serbs and the other minorities, and the Kosovo Albanian majority should sit down and agree on what their future is."We have not said that we favour any specific outcome because that would be inappropriate." 
 During a visit to Pristina on 8 June, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said that, in Washington's view, Kosovo has made "enough progress" in meeting standards. 
 The hostage taking sparked vigils in Bucharest's University Square and elsewhere, appeals from the Muslim community in Romania, and intensive negotiations. 
 He says Monaf discovered a business opportunity in Baghdad and suggested taking some journalists along to generate publicity. 
  New US-Assisted Project Completed in Croatia  22/06/2005 The reconstruction of a school gymnasium in the Croatian town of Obrovac is the latest humanitarian assistance project to be completed with financial support from the US military's European Command.  (US Embassy in Croatia - 14/06/05; Croatian Ministry of the Seas, Tourism, Transportation and Development, Radio Zadar - 13/06/05) 
 Croatian Deputy Minister of Seas, Tourism, Transportation and Development Ljudevit Herceg and US Ambassador to Croatia Ralph Frank opened a newly reconstructed gymnasium at the primary and secondary school in the town of Obrovac on 13 June. 
 The Croatian Ministry of the Seas, Transportation, Tourism and Development contributed nearly $269,000. 
 This project follows several similar ones completed with EUCOM and USAID support and in close co-operation and financial cost sharing with the seas, transportation, tourism and development ministry. 
 Those include a construction and reconstruction project in Pakrac that helped double the capacity of a dormitory for secondary school students. 
 Other examples include the reconstruction of the primary schools in Batinjani, completed in May 2002, and in the village of Gorice in the Municipality of Dragalic, in December 2001. 
 Annan has indicated that he intends to move "very carefully" in the search of a solution, given the situation. 
  Robust Growth in Romanian Card Market  23/06/2005 The Romanian credit and debit cards market grew in the last twelve months by almost 25 per cent, and there is still plenty of room for further expansion.  By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 23/06/05 Ten years ago, when a local bank launched Romania's first credit card, only one shop in Bucharest's downtown was able to accept electronic payments. 
 Nowadays, there are about 6.2m credit and debit cards in Romanians' wallets and that number is climbing. 
 According to statistics from the Romanian National Bank (BNR), about 1.2m new cards were issued during the past 12 months. 
 Experts say if this pace continues, Romania could have 7m valid cards in circulation by the end of this year. 
 Banks expect credit cards, rather than debit cards, to show the most spectacular growth. 
 Today they only represent about 5 per cent of the total number of cards in Romania, but this proportion could double by December, bank officials say. 
 Although international giants Visa and MasterCard dominate the Romanian market, other companies are starting to issue their own cards. 
 If I go to the supermarket or to the restaurant and my card doesn't work, what would it be like," says Tina Manescu, a 26-year-old secretary. 
 Such opinions have been buttressed by card related crimes, including the installation in a Bucharest neighbourhood of a fake cash machine, which read the information on users' cards. 
 It's a sign that Romanian criminal groups who emptied the bank accounts of thousands of Westerners by cloning their cards have now turned their eyes to their own country. 
  Ancient Thermal City to Be Flooded in Turkey  23/06/2005 Archeologists, environmentalists and international NGOs are joining together to try to find a way to save an 1,800-year-old archeological site, due to be flooded this November by the waters from a new dam.  By Allan Cove for Southeast European Times � 23/06/05 The world's oldest known ancient thermal city, Allianoi, stands to be flooded when the Yortanli Dam begins operation this November. 
 To help save the 1,800-year-old city, environmentalists and other volunteers have formed the Allianoi Initiative Group, with the slogan "Don't Let Allianoi Be Flooded". 
 Villagers in the area, many of whom earn their living from agriculture, have mixed feelings. 
  Polls: Bulgarian Parliamentary Vote a Cliffhanger  24/06/2005 Bulgaria heads into key parliamentary elections on Saturday and pollsters are describing the race as the most unpredictable in the last 15 years.   (Bloomberg, Reuters, Angus Reid Consultants, Sofia News Agency - 24/06/05; AFP, The Christian Science Monitor, FT, UPI, The Daily Telegraph, BNN, Sofia News Agency, BTA - 23/06/05; Alpha Research - 22/06/05) 
 But the make-up of parliament remains anyone's guess, in part because an unusually large number of parties have a chance of winning seats. 
 The latest polls, however, show that an unprecedented eight parties and coalitions stand a chance of surpassing the 4 per cent threshold for entry into the 240-seat assembly. 
 Others expected to win seats include former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov's right-wing Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB), with 7.4 per cent, and the newly-formed ultranationalist Ataka (Attack) coalition, which is polling around 7.2 per cent. 
 A survey conducted by Alpha Research polling agency produced similar results, with only a different line-up for the parties and coalitions in the last five places. 
 On the basis of the results of the MBMD and Alpha Research polls, the BSP could win between 95 and 106 parliamentary seats, falling short of the outright majority needed to run the country on its own. 
 The mini-plants will have a total power capacity of 20 MW and will produce 300 million kWh of electricity. 
 Currently, annual production of electricity in Macedonia is 1.5 billion kWh. 
 Experts anticipate the total production of electricity will be around 7 billion kWh by the end of this year. 
 That could be a challenge, as only one of the other six parties that won parliamentary seats has signalled its readiness to join the former communists. 
 With nearly all the votes counted, the BSP won 31 per cent of the vote, entitling the Coalition for Bulgaria it leads to 82 seats in the 240-member legislature. 
 The current ruling party, the National Movement for Simeon II (NMS-II), came in second with 19.88 per cent, or 53 seats, and its junior coalition partner, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), was third with 12.68 per cent, or 34 seats. 
 A newcomer to the political arena, the radical nationalist organisation Attack came in fourth with 8.16 per cent or 21 seats, stunning politicians and analysts alike. 
 It finished ahead of the right-wing United Democratic Forces (UtDF), Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB) and Bulgarian Popular Union (BPU), which won 7.70 per cent or 20 seats, 6.45 per cent or 17 seats and 5.20 per cent or 13 seats, respectively. 
 The three right-wing formations, which will together take only 50 of the parliamentary seats, are unlikely to back a BSP-led government. 
 The United States is funding their transportation, food and accommodation, and any urgent medical care, while Macedonia is covering other costs. 
  Initiatives Needed for Olympic Infrastructure in Greece   27/06/2005 Now that the athletes and visitors are long gone, Greece faces the challenge of coming up with a long-term plan for making use of its costly Olympic infrastructure.  by Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens � 27/06/05 In the lead-up to the 2004 Summer Olympics, Greek officials hailed the Games as a great investment for the country. 
 As a result, Athens has not been able to successfully reap the fruits of this important global event. 
 The Athens Olympic Stadium, one of the most magnificent stadiums in the world, is currently being used by soccer teams. 
 In all, EU assistance for the project totalled 540,000 euros, covering both the St. Atanasie church and the mosque in the nearby village of Neprosteno. 
 "The EU is funding this project to erase the scars of the conflict and to restore understanding between the communities." 
 Father Dimitrija Krstevski of St. Atanasie and Imam Ejup Selmani of the Neprosteno Mosque visited each other's places of worship to mark the beginning of reconstruction and to underscore their support for reconciliation. 
 As police began to search him, the man reportedly panicked and pulled the bomb's fuse, but the main explosive did not ignite. 
 After the incident, police cordoned off the area, located in the capital's busy administrative centre, while bomb squad agents searched the body. 
 The Central Election Commission (CEC) also established a free telephone line providing information on voting procedures. 
 Karamanlis also accepted an invitation to visit Ankara, which will make him the first Greek leader to visit Turkey in more than 46 years.   (CNN, SBS, Kathimerini, Reporter.gr - 04/07/05; AP, AFP, Reuters, BBC, The Hellenic Radio, Athens News Agency - 03/07/05) 
 Initially, the pipeline will supply about 3.5 billion cubic metres of gas per year, with its capacity expected to eventually reach 11.5 billion cubic metres per annum. 
 Last year, Erdogan became the first top Turkish official to visit Athens in 16 years. 
 After eight years in opposition, the BSP won the elections with 31 per cent of the vote, or 82 seats in the country's 240-member legislature. 
 The ruling National Movement for Simeon II (NMS-II) came in second with 20 per cent, or 53 seats, and the MRF was third with 13 per cent, or 34 seats. 
 Four other formations also passed the 4 per cent threshold for entry into the parliament, taking a total of 50 seats, while a radical national coalition came in fourth, winning 21 seats. 
 The fourth possible scenario he listed was for an even broader coalition, including the BSP, the NMS-II, the MRF and the right-wing Bulgarian People's Union, which won less than 6 per cent of the vote, or 13 parliamentary seats. 
 Officials say the redenomination marks the end of the inflation cycle and will help ease the way towards the eventual adoption of the euro.  By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 04/07/05 Since 1 July, Romanians have been carrying two types of currency in their wallets: the existing Romanian leu (ROL) and its successor, nicknamed the "heavy leu" (RON). 
 Dan Pascariu, the president of HVB Romania, is unhappy with the 18-month period during which the two currencies will circulate together. 
 Some villagers believe that everything will be cheaper after the denomination, while others are afraid they will be allowed to exchange only a small amount of the old currency into the new one. 
 "I remember in 1952 people were burning sacks full of money in the ovens because the banks refused to exchange big sums," recalls Dumitru Balus, 83, a villager from eastern Romania, about the last denomination. 
 Some 2.8 million Albanians were eligible to vote, choosing among 22 political parties and coalitions running for the 140-seat parliament, 100 elected directly and 40 from party lists. 
 "The Macedonian state institutions have a capacity, legal mechanisms applicable on the entire territory, and capability to fully respect the decision of the Court Chamber regarding the guarantee," the minister added, pledging Macedonian authorities' full co-operation with the court. 
 The atrocities for which they have been charged were committed between 10 August and 12 August 2001, during a police raid on the village of Ljuboten. 
 The BSP won 31 per cent of the vote, which translates into 82 seats in the 240-seat unicameral legislature. 
 The ruling centrist National Movement for Simeon II (NMS-II) came in second with 20 per cent, or 53 seats, and the Movements for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) was third with 13 per cent, or 34 seats. 
 The remaining 71 seats are divided among four other parties and coalitions. 
 "Whether we will be able to provide local or long distance or international telephone services, what will be the legislative framework, what will be the financial framework, someone will have to define the licenses, some permits, some service costs, whether it will be fully deregulated -- at this time absolutely nothing is known, and on the other hand the amount of investment required is huge," says Predrag Milicevic of Serbian Broadband Network, one of the leading cable companies. 
 "It's not just that we have a cable, that anyone can buy a telephone and sign up with us. 
 On Wednesday afternoon, Mesic and Tadic visited the northern city of Subotica for meetings with Croatian minority representatives and Serb refugees from Croatia, and to attend the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Croats. 
 Most political analysts believe the main factor behind the decision to call an early poll is the desire of the PD and the National Liberal Party (PNL) -- the two parties forming the DA Alliance -- to strengthen their slim majority by increasing their number of seats in the two chambers of parliament. 
 As many as 50,000 people are expected to gather in Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) eastern town of Srebrenica on Monday (11 July) to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the single worst atrocity in Europe since the end of World War II. 
 The three parties with the largest representation are the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), with 82 seats, the National Movement for Simeon II (NMSII), with 53 seats, and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), with 34 seats. 
 The way now appears to be clear for formation of a strong centre-right bloc in Romania, marking a significant sea change in domestic politics. 
 According to current DP leader, Cluj Mayor Emil Boc, it is a natural evolution that formally recognises the party's repositioning to the centre. 
 For his part, Basescu ran a campaign steeped in centre-right rhetoric, criticising welfare dependency and calling on Romanians to "put away the theory of the paternalist state, which takes care of the slothful". 
 Addressing tens of thousand of mourners, they acknowledged the international community's share of responsibility for the atrocity, while pledging persistent efforts to bring to justice those who orchestrated it -- wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic. 
 During the ceremony at the Potocari memorial centre outside Srebrenica, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, also expressed his personal remorse over the massacre, describing it as "one of the darkest chapters" in European history since 1945. 
 Many seek to minimise the atrocity or insist that Serbs suffered equally. 
 And attempts to show respect for the victims have met with threats.  By Jelena Tusup for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 12/07/05 On the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, Serbs still have an ambiguous view of Europe's worst atrocity since World War II. 
 Newspapers provided extensive coverage of Serbian President Boris Tadic's visit to Potocari, as well as commentary and reminiscences concerning events in Srebrenica in July 1995. 
 The clearest message came from Tadic, who attended the Potocari ceremony. 
 Although the Democrats are said to have won a clear majority in the country's 140-seat legislature, they are unlikely to be able to form a government before the end of this month. 
 A count of the votes cast in 97 out of the 100 single-seat constituencies, showed the DP winning 55 parliamentary seats. 
 The SP trailed with 40 seats, while an independent candidate and former Prime Minister Ilir Meta's Party of Socialist Movement took the other two seats. 
 Under Albanian law, the remaining 40 seats are distributed through proportional allocations depending on the percentage of the vote parties surpassing the 2.5 per cent threshold have won nationwide. 
 The additional seats the DP and its allies are said to have won on the basis of this system give them an at least 73-seat majority, allowing them to form a government. 
 The SP and its allies would take a total of 64 seats. 
 Berisha could eventually end up with fewer parliamentary seats, which would dilute his strength in the 140-member assembly. 
 The framework would build upon already existing plans, adopted in the wake of the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington and after the March 2004 train bombings in Madrid. 
 Under the proposed measure, telecommunications companies would be required to store details of all telephone calls, e-mails and Web traffic for at least 12 months. 
 Other issues likely to raise controversy include measures for countering radicalisation and recruitment, for strengthening the visa information system and the Schengen information system, and for the adoption of common standards for ID cards. 
 Britain is expected to push for the inclusion of biometric details in all ID cards. 
 Decentralised authority means that local mayors and their teams will assume responsibility for almost all functions previously performed by the finance, transport, labour, education and culture ministries. 
 "The first phase �means the start of a new process leading to a more accessible local authority, strengthening local democracy and intensified participation of citizens in local governance," said a joint statement signed by EU Special Representative Michael Sahlin, head of the EU Delegation Donato Chiarini, US Acting Ambassador in Macedonia Paul Wohlers, OSCE Ambassador Carlos Pais and NATO High Representative Dennis Blease. 
 While members of parliament and government employees who travel by plane and obtain their refunds at airports may not face this problem, many ordinary citizens still favour the car. 
 He said army helicopters are airlifting food, drinking water and other emergency aid to stranded villagers. 
 Food, flooring, tires and electronics are among the products slated for export under the new arrangement.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 18/07/05 With US President George W. Bush's decision last month to grant Serbia-Montenegro preferential export status, the final remaining sanctions Washington imposed in 1992 against the former Yugoslavia have been lifted. 
 Washington's goal in providing the preferential export status is to help boost the development of Serbia-Montenegro's economy, Polt said. 
 Two bidders -- a group of Turkey's Koc Holding and the US-based Carlyle Group, and a consortium led by a unit of mobile operator Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri -- withdrew early on. 
  Extremists Suspected in Attacks on Macedonian Police Stations  20/07/2005 No one has yet claimed responsibility for two recent attacks on police stations in Macedonia, but some are linking them to an armed group active in the village of Kondovo. 
 On 12 July, three shells from a hand-operated missile launcher were fired at the station in the village of Vratnica, near Tetovo. 
 The explosion at Bit Pazar occurred only a few hours after Macedonia's National Security Council met to discuss the situation in the village of Kondovo, where police have not been patrolling for several months because of threats by a heavily armed criminal group, led by Agim Krasniqi. 
 Police are under orders from the National Security Council to restore law and order in Kondovo, and authorities say most villagers are opposed to Krasniqi and his armed group. 
 Some lawmakers are even rumoured to have launched their parliamentary careers precisely to escape possible fraud charges. 
 The shootout followed terrorist attacks earlier this month in two Aegean Sea resorts. 
 The atrocities for which they have been charged were committed between 10 August and 12 August 2001, during a police raid on the village of Ljuboten. 
 The move is part of the country's effort to deregulate its energy market, in accordance with EU guidelines.   By Vassilis Vassiliou for Southeast European Times in Athens � 25/07/05 With the Development Ministry's decision to publicise the energy industry's operation codes, including the prices set for suppliers, Greece has officially launched an energy privatisation programme. 
 This figure is expected to double within five years, giving private suppliers a 30 per cent share of the market the public electricity company has today. 
 However, the blow to Greeks' pocketbooks will be potentially offset by improvements in the system. 
 Power will now be more reliably delivered to areas of the country that lack adequate access to electricity. 
 There will be three possible types of providers: the current public company, newly-created private companies and foreign power importers from nearby countries like Bulgaria, which already export electricity. 
  Cyprus, US Sign Counterproliferation Shipboarding Agreement  26/07/2005 The United States and Cyprus signed a shipboarding agreement Monday as part of the Proliferation Security Initiative, which aims to stop shipments of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and related materials.  (News.com.au, People's Daily - 26/07/05; Washington File, Cyprus News Agency - 25/07/05) 
 The United States and Cyprus have concluded a reciprocal shipboarding agreement that will facilitate co-operation between the two countries in the prevention of the transfer of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by sea. 
 The accord, signed by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Cypriot Foreign Minister George Iakovou in Washington on Monday (25 July), is part of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). 
 "The combination of states, with which we have boarding agreements and Proliferation Security Initiative partner commitments, means that more than 60 per cent of the global commercial shipping fleet dead-weight tonnage is now subject to rapid action consent procedures for boarding, search and seizure," the US State Department said. 
 The deal allows either country to ask the other to confirm the nationality of a US- or Cypriot-flagged ship suspected of carrying WMD-related cargo. 
 It gives the other permission to board, search, and -- if needed -- detain the vessel in question and its cargo. 
 Monday's agreement, it added, also sends a clear message to proliferators that neither of the two countries "will tolerate the involvement of their vessels in the trade of proliferation-related cargoes". 
  Jose Carreras Opens Ohrid Festival  26/07/2005 World-renowned tenor Jose Carreras, together with soprano Tina Gorina, performed a two-hour-long concert at the Antique Theatre in Ohrid. 
 In attendance were the presidents of Albania, Bulgaria and Serbia-Montenegro, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina's prime minister.  By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 26/07/05 World-renowned opera tenor Jose Carreras sang in Ohrid on 12 July, opening the 45th International Ohrid Summer Festival. 
 Carreras performed in front of a more than 2,500-strong audience that included Albanian President Alfred Moisiu, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and the diplomatic corps in Macedonia. 
 Presenting himself for the first time to the Macedonian audience, Carreras and soprano Tina Gorina performed popular pieces by Spanish authors, opera arias by Caballero, Himenes, Lehar, Cesarini and Costa Guno. 
 At the end of the performance, the cheering audience called Carreras back on stage six times. 
 Carreras was Ohrid's guest for three days. 
 At a press conference on 11 July, Carreras announced that he will sing with Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti at the next football championship in Germany. 
 Among the other factors impeding sustainable returns are the lack of jobs and economic opportunities and the persistent lack of access to basic infrastructures, such as electricity and water supply, in some refugee return areas. 
 "When Croatia carries out these two steps, as well as its commitments towards the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the implementation of the [OSCE] mission mandate could be very well advanced," Fuentes said. 
 Participants stressed the need for co-existence and respect for cultural and religious monuments.   By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 28/07/05 St. Atanasie Church in the village of Lesok has been reopened for worship, thanks in part to EU assistance. 
 The rocks were preserved, enumerated and sorted out by the Institute for Protection of Monuments, which carried out the project. 
 A hospital for respiratory diseases within the monastery compound will be rebuilt with a donation from Norway, Sekerinska said. 
 But under the laws in effect at the time, judges say, 15 years was the maximum they could give.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 28/07/05 In October 1999, an armored truck swerved across the Ibar highway, south of Belgrade, and hit a convoy of cars carrying Serbian opposition politician Vuk Draskovic and his associates. 
 NATO troops have often raided the homes of members of the Karadzic family in search of clues that could lead to the fugitive's capture. 
 A day before the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre on 11 July, the couple's son, Aleksandar, was arrested and held for nearly 10 days on suspicion of providing support to his father. 
 The exercises included co-ordination of land, air and sea operations and methods of public communication. 
 "Co-operative Engagement 2005" began just days after indications from Brussels and Washington that the process of NATO enlargement would likely be delayed until 2008. 
 Under the plans, their membership bids depend on their capacity to fulfil their commitments to defence reform and democratisation.

 The firm has become an engine of local economic growth, providing jobs to nearly 9,000 workers in the city of Smederovo. 
 While in Serbia-Montenegro, DiCarlo paid a visit to the Economic Development Centre established by US Steel in downtown Belgrade. 
 US Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Michael C. Polt echoed DiCarlo's remarks, emphasising that Washington considers it very important to step up economic co-operation with the Balkan country.

 "There is no indication at this stage for anyone to be taking this drug other than the very high-risk groups in areas in which the avian disease has become a problem," he added. 
 Greek experts are presently conducting tests to discover whether a case of bird flu at a turkey farm on the Aegean island of Oinouses involves the lethal H5N1 strain, which has led to more than 60 deaths in Asia. 
 He also praised Turkey and Romania for their efforts to contain the spread of the disease by imposing travel restrictions on affected areas and taking other measures, including the culling of thousands of birds. 
 Noting that the incubation period for the bird flu detected in the village of Kiziksa, some 120km from Istanbul, had passed, Turkish veterinarians say they believe the H5N1 outbreak has been contained and there is no danger of it spreading.

  Concern over Avian flu affecting Romanian economy  20/10/2005 Worries about bird flu have hurt Romania's poultry and restaurant industries, as well as Danube delta tourism.   By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 20/10/05 "Their heads turn violet, breathing becomes harder and harder, and in few hours they're dead," a woman in Ceamurlia de Jos village said about domestic birds suffering from avian flu. 
 Other farmers in the village -- the first place where the disease was found in Romania this month -- said they simply killed the affected chickens, ducks and geese and ate them. 
 The measures were not easy to implement -- some people wanted to stop the authorities from taking away their chickens, while others were reluctant to stay put in the village. 
 "Meanwhile, we put under quarantine, beside Ceamurlia de Jos, two other Danube Delta villages, Maliuc and Vulturu, where we found some dead swans and domestic birds," Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur told reporters. 
 Although villagers may have eaten flu-stricken chickens without any adverse effect, alarm over the outbreak has affected the poultry industry. 
 "Two thirds of the reservations I had for the last weekend didn't show up, but it will be worse if the 2006 season for the Black Sea hotels is affected.

  Households, businesses suffer as Albania faces severe electricity crisis  08/11/2005 Many Albanians are now going most of the day without electricity, due to a crippling electricity shortage. 
 The country's communist-era hydroelectric plants cannot keep up with demand, and supplies from abroad do not bridge the gap.   By Erlis Selimaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana � 08/11/05 Electricity restrictions deepened on Sunday (6 November) as the Albanian Electro-energetic Corporation (KESH) extended a mandatory blackout for both urban and rural areas. 
 The supply of electricity in urban areas is being cut off from 7:30 am to 4:00 pm. 
 Electricity outages are alternated every two hours after 4:00 pm. 
 In some places, Albanians could face as many as 18 hours daily without electricity. 
 In addition, the energy crisis reflects the poor condition of hydroelectric power plants -- the country's only electricity source -- and the lack of foreign investment in the sector over the past 16 years. 
 Albania imports almost 5m kW of electricity a year from Macedonia and Greece, but the amount is nowhere near sufficient. 
 They are considering offering us electricity for the period November-December. 
 The electricity from Ukraine would pass through Romania and Serbia, so we are also negotiating with these countries to transmit the electricity," said Economy Minister Genc Ruli, appealing to the public to conserve.

  New company to replace Greece's Olympic Airlines   16/11/2005 Having failed to find a buyer for Olympic Airlines, Greece said on Tuesday it plans to launch a new company in April to replace its money-losing national carrier.   (AP, Reuters, Xinhua, Athens News Agency, The Hellenic Radio, Kathimerini � 15/11/05) 
 The announcement followed the authorities' latest failed attempt to find a buyer for the country's ailing flag carrier. 
 The subsidy gave the carrier an unfair advantage over competitors, the commission said, handing Greece a two-month deadline to decide what measures it will take to comply with the decision. 
 Olympic currently flies to 75 domestic and international destinations and carried about 5 million passengers in 2004. 
 Local media reports suggested that about half the 6,000 people currently working at Olympic Airlines and affiliated state companies stand to lose their jobs, and the carrier's fleet of 40 aircraft will be downsized to between 25 and 30. 
 "We have declared that starting from 2006 we would not use the MiG-19 war airplanes. 
 MiG-19 airplanes are a security risk and do not comply with NATO standards," Qazimi said. 
 Top Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials are expected to take their seats at the negotiating table at a later stage.

  Inquiry into Lovas war crimes case under way in Serbia  29/11/2005 Serbian war crimes prosecutors are working together with counterparts in Croatia to establish the truth about 1991 atrocities in the Croatian village of Lovas, where some 24 civilians were killed when the Yugoslav National Army ordered them to walk through a minefield.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 29/11/05 One more war crimes case is under way in Serbian domestic courts. 
 In October, the republic's prosecutor for war crimes, Vladimir Vukcevic, began proceedings to establish responsibility for the murder of Croatian civilians in the village of Lovas, near Iloka, in the fall of 1991. 
 On 10 October 1991, members of the Yugoslav National Army's (JNA) Novi Sad Corps, local territorial defence units and the "Dusan Silni" paramilitary group launched an artillery attack on the Croatian village of Lovas, killing as many as 30 residents in the process. 
 After the forces took control of the village, they reportedly subjected its non-Serb population to abuses including forced labour, torture and rape. 
 According to Devetak, an order to round up Croats and force them into the minefield was probably given by a Lieutenant Colonel Dimitrijevic, the village commander at the time. 
 His immediate superior was Colonel Dusan Loncar, later promoted to general

(AP, Reuters, DTT-NET, Radio B92, OSCE - 05/12/05) 
 US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns has indicated that Washington will not support a solution to the Kosovo status issue implying a division of the province along ethnic lines, or a change of its current borders.

 The plant, which will have a total capacity life of 40 years, is designed to fully meet both the Bulgarian and the EU technical and environmental requirements and standards. 
 The project will help Bulgaria make up for the energy capacity it stands to lose by the closure of two 440-megawatt nuclear reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. 
 Serbian officials are now waiting for the meeting of the IMF Board of Directors in Washington at the end of January -- where the agreement should be concluded. 
 Within 24 hours of the belt-tightening budget being passed -- along with laws that bring reforms to healthcare and limit salaries in the government sector -- Sorsa returned to Belgrade. 
 The two most recent reductions in public expenditure touched upon sensitive points of a post-socialist society -- the reform of the state pension system and healthcare insurance.

 The suspects were on trial for the summary execution of Croatian prisoners, who were taken to the Ovcara farm outside Vukovar and shot to death after the town fell to Serb forces. 
 The Hague tribunal has indicted former Vukovar Mayor Slavko Dokmanovic, three former Yugoslav People's Army officers -- Mile Mrksic, Veselin Sljivancanin and Miroslav Radic -- and former regional government head Goran Hadzic for crimes committed during the fighting.

 "Only the political will and the commitment of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to bring to justice those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed during the war can make peace sustainable," Amnesty's programme director for Europe and Central Asia, Nicola Duckworth, said. 
 While praising the outcome of two recent trials in RS, which ended with the conviction of four Bosnian Serb war criminals, Amnesty expressed doubt about the ability of local courts to try war crimes cases, given their lack of resources, capacity and the political will for dealing with such cases. 
 Persistent problems, including lack of access to employment, education, health care, social services and pensions, continue to impede refugee returns, and ethnically-based discrimination is "widespread and ongoing", the group said. 
 "They have shown fortitude and patience, ingenuity and a capacity to forgive. 
 However, that may be changing.  By Vassilis Vassiliou for Southeast European Times in Athens � 16/12/05 Reported cases of medical mistakes have tripled over the last five years in Greece, as more victims of malpractice choose to seek legal recourse despite formidable obstacles. 
 According to the only survey conducted into the issue over the past five years, as many as 20 people die and up to 200 are injured every day as a result of faulty medical care. 
 A huge crowd gathered in the main city square for an official celebration. 
 EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn explained that the EC did not propose a date for the start of negotiations, as that depends on the capacity of Macedonia to implement the membership criteria. 
 The absorption capacity of the Union also has to be taken into account," the leaders said. 
 The call followed a damning report Thursday by UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who described Serbia's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) as having deteriorated in recent months. 
 Cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since Turkey invaded the north of the island in 1974, following an Athens-backed coup that sought to unite Cyprus with Greece. 
 "Adoption of the constitutional amendments is a huge step in carrying out reforms in the judiciary," said Justice Minister Meri Mladenovska-Gjorgievska. 
 In neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, meanwhile, NATO troops conducted searches Tuesday at two businesses that may be helping Mladic evade arrest and extradition to The Hague. 
 In a statement, NATO said the raid was carried out to obtain information about the fugitive's support network. 
 Some argued that certain staples -- such as bread, milk, medicine and books -- should be tax-free. 
 The BiH Council of Ministers has suggested keeping newspapers and books tax-free, amid warnings from publishers that they will not be able to stay in business due to further reductions in already low sales. 
 Petrasevic says Slobodan Medic, the commander of the Scorpions unit, ordered the captives' execution and also insisted that it be video-recorded, presumably as proof that he carried out the orders of his superiors. 
 In Washington, congressional supporters of NATO membership for Croatia say that with Gotovina's arrest, the main obstacle has disappeared. 
 More than 200,000 people, including some 40,000 Turkish Cypriots, were displaced as a result of the invasion, which followed an Athens-backed coup that sought to unite Cyprus with Greece.

 Branko Grujic, the 61-year-old former mayor of the northeastern Bosnian town of Zvornik, has been charged in connection with the 1992 slayings of at least 22 Muslims and the expulsion of 1,822 others. 
 According to the indictment, Grujic and Popovic failed to prevent the Yellow Hornets from carrying out a campaign of murder, rape and other abuse against Muslim civilians after Serb forces took the ethnically mixed town of Zvornik in April 1992. 
 The local Serb Democratic Party leadership, aided by paramilitaries, conducted a systematic campaign of deportations and property confiscation against the Muslim population in the town, as well as in surrounding villages. 
 The top priority, according to the minister, was to carry out land reforms to allow the sale of city building land and its privatisation. 
 But if you wanted to see all cards on the table than you should not be unsatisfied," the ambassador said. 
 With their hands tied behind their backs, the captives -- two of them underage -- were taken off a truck in the village of Godinska Bara near Trnovo in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
 Four were shot in the back, while the other two were ordered to carry the bodies into a barn before being also killed. 
 The arrest appeared to confirm charges by UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who has repeatedly said that military structures -- especially military intelligence -- are still protecting Mladic. 
 As the offers were officially opened Wednesday, Yulian Zhelyazkov of Bulgaria's National Electricity Company (NEK), who heads the Belene NPP tender commission, said the evaluation procedures would likely be completed in no less than six months' time. 
 Seeking to offset an expected drop in the country's electricity output following the planned shutdown of two 440-megawatt Soviet-era reactors at the Kozloduy NPP in December 2006, and to help sustain its leading position on the regional power market, Bulgaria gave the green light for the Belene plant last April. 
 Currently, Kozloduy accounts for about 40 per cent of Bulgaria's overall electricity output. 
 The Sofia daily  Trud  quoted representatives of both companies as insisting Wednesday that, if they are selected, the price of electricity will be "sufficiently low"

 The events will take place at seven sites, including in Turin, Bardonecchia and Sestriere, which will also host the three Olympic villages. 
 "The opening ceremony on Friday, with the lighting of the Olympic cauldron, symbol of brotherhood among people, will be a moment full of emotion for us Italians, for sports people all over the world," Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said on Tuesday. 
 The opening ceremony will be attended by 15 heads of state and government; 46 sports ministers; first ladies, including Laura Bush and Cherie Blair; and royalty, including Spain's King Juan Carlos, Harald of Norway and Albert of Monaco.

 Croatia's Janica Kostelic, who won triple gold and a silver at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, could improve that record by medalling in each of the alpine skiing disciplines in which she will compete. 
 Her first start is in the Ladies' Downhill event at San Sicario Fraiteve on 15 February. 
 She has won in all of them during this season's World Cup circuit. 
 Bulgaria, which won one silver and two bronze medals at the Salt Lake City Games and one gold at Nagano in 1998, is also hoping to do better this time around. 
 Ekaterina Dafovska, who won Bulgaria's first-ever Winter Olympics gold medal in the women's biathlon 15km individual event in Nagano eight years ago, will carry her country's flag at the opening ceremony Friday.

 The H5N1 strain of bird flu has killed 90 people since 2003, mostly in Asia. 
 An outbreak of the disease in Turkey in recent months has claimed four lives. 
 They said on Sunday they had imposed a quarantine on a region near two lakes on Bulgaria's northern Black Sea coast amid suspicions of possible bird flu cases. 
 Dead birds found in the Ticha dam on Sunday sparked panic among residents of the northeastern city of Shumen, which relies on the reservoir for its water supply. 
 Even if the birds were infected with the deadly virus, it is unlikely the disease could spread through water, they said. 
 The latest case, bringing the number of affected sites to a total of 29, was in the village of Tropaisar, near the eastern city of Constanta. 
 Fowl from a household farm in the village of Sarina Suf in the Danube Delta and in the southwest village of Cetate, also located on the Danube River, are also believed to be infected with avian flu. 
  BiH airline successfully resurrected  13/02/2006 BH airlines, the newly resurrected FBiH carrier, hopes to carve a niche in the regional market by offering low prices and high quality passenger service.

 "Public health has gotten worse while funds allocated to health care have grown steadily," Tariceanu said, noting that in 2005 alone, Romania spent 2.8 billion euros on health care. 
 While life expectancy in the EU exceeds 78.5 years, it is only 71.2 years in Romania, Tariceanu said, adding that Romanians continue to suffer from diseases -- tuberculosis, for instance -- which should have disappeared years ago. 
 I think that CEFTA is a possibility which we are considering carefully," Rehn told Croatian television late last month. 
 On Monday, Rehn said chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte continues to assess Belgrade's co-operation with the ICTY as inadequate, pointing especially to its failure to hand over former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic.

(Reuters, Athens News Agency, Macedonian Press Agency, Hellenic Radio, Cyprus News Agency, Makfax - 15/02/06) 
 Finance Minister Giorgos Alogoskoufis, Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas and Education Minister Marietta Giannakou retained their seats. 
 Bakoyannis, the first woman to be put in charge of Greek foreign policy and a popular Athens mayor since October 2002, replaced veteran diplomat Petros Molyviatis in this second highest government post. 
 A high-profile figure in Greek political life, Bakoyannis left her position as ND deputy ahead of the October 2002 local elections to join the Athens mayoral race. 
 "Our foreign policy is exercised with the aim to � advance the principles of democracy and the peaceful resolution of differences," the Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted her as saying, pledging to exercise diplomacy with "principles, a programme, realism, and creativity". 
 What Athens wants more than anything, ANA quoted Karamanlis as also noting, is a settlement of the Cyprus issue so the last remaining walls on European territory would fall. 
  Banja Luka barracks turned into University City  16/02/2006 The former headquarters of the Republika Srpska Army is now home to college students, following the local government's decision to hand over the barracks to Banja Luka University.  By Vlatko Vukotic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka -- 16/02/06 At a former Republika Srpska (RS) Army barracks, buildings have been reconstructed to provide room for a different kind of activity: higher education. 
 Last year, Banja Luka University became the owner of the complex, which is comprised of 41 buildings. 
 In light of this, the local government in Banja Luka handed over the barracks -- formerly the site of RS Army Headquarters -- to the university, where 15,000 students are enrolled. 
 More than 3.5m euros are being be spent in constructing the new University City. 
 University officials have given them permission to enter their dormitory, but the building has been without heat and lacks furniture and other necessary equipment. 
 The university's relocation is taking place against the backdrop of efforts to improve the quality of higher education throughout BiH. 
  Ignoring copyrights still a problem in Serbia  16/02/2006 Although copyright protection laws are on the books, enforcement is haphazard.

 The H5N1 strain has claimed the lives of at least 90 people since early 2003, mostly in Southeast Asia, where the infection first appeared. 
 The country was already facing a regional ban for imports of poultry meat, eggs and products from wild fowl from ten counties hit by another bird illness, known as Newcastle disease. 
 Serbian Minister for Local Governments Zoran Loncar said on Thursday that Belgrade would not recognise Montenegro's referendum if it follows the rules suggested by the EU. 
 According to Reuters, the Kosovo and Serbian sides held separate breakfast meetings with UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari before taking their seats at a horseshoe-shaped table at the 18th-century Palais Daun-Kinsky. 
 That assessment, in turn, will depend on UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte's opinion. 
 Sara, played by Luna Mijanovic, believes that her father died a hero's death while defending the BiH capital. 
 Another BiH director, Danis Tanovic, has won a total of 42 awards for his antiwar movie "No Man's Land", including the 2002 Oscar for Best Foreign Film, as well as a Golden Globe from the Venice Film Festival in 2002 and a Golden Palm from the Cannes festival in 2001. 
 "I think that all the measures that are being taken by state and local offices in the field will be sufficient and that the disease will be localised to the area where it was discovered." 
 While H5N1 has been detected in chickens in more than 30 villages in Romania and in parts of Ukraine, the outbreaks in Bulgaria and in the seven EU member nations affected thus far have only hit wild birds such as swans and ducks. 
 The lethal H5N1 strain has killed at least 90 people since early 2003, including four in Turkey in January, less than three months after the first outbreak of the disease in the country. 
 BiH authorities have raised objections, saying the project might block the country's access to the Adriatic Sea. 
 Accusing the PSD of being responsible for the current poor state of the country's health system, Tariceanu said the only motive for the opposition's move was to block health reforms designed to improve patient care. 
 "We are creating a health care system for the benefit of the citizens, not for the benefit of some people who work in the system," the prime minister said during a joint session of parliament. 
 "The public health has gotten worse while funds allocated to health care have grown steadily," he stressed, noting that in 2005 alone, Romania spent 2.8 billion euros on health care. 
 Barroso also touched on another key issue -- liberalising the EU's visa regime for researchers, students and members of the business community. 
 The first one is a 47.9m-euro CARDS programme for regional projects, and the second involves an additional 6m euros from CARDS use in the police reform process. 
 "These include movement restrictions, strict monitoring of vaccinated flocks to ensure that there is no undetected outbreak of avian influenza, and careful record-keeping. 
 While inoculation can protect poultry, the birds could remain carriers of the virus without showing symptoms. 
 The H5N1 avian flu virus has killed at least 92 people since 2003, mostly in Asia, but there has been no evidence so far of the virus being spread from person to person. 
 EU health ministers and experts from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are due to meet in Vienna on Friday to discuss further efforts to control bird flu outbreaks. 
 Last year, an Albanian immigrants' organisation proposed that the ministry use a combination of television programming and textbooks to reach children residing in other countries. 
 A $50m credit from the World Bank for restructuring the economy depends on opening this tender, while the future of EPS -- and the price the public will be paying for electricity -- depends on the outcome. 
 The price of electricity could potentially increase two-and-a-half times, but due to subsidies, would remain among the lowest priced in the region. 
 Indeed, electricity prices in Serbia are still kept at a "socialist" level, rather than being determined by the market. 
 According to one of its senior economists, David Kennedy, the Bank does not want privatisation of EPS to take place immediately -- rather, any privatisation scheme should be carefully prepared. 
 "We shall persist in carrying out the independence referendum according to European standards," the Montenegrin prime minister said. 
 However, health experts warn the disease continues to pose a threat.  By Allan Cove for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 28/02/06 Following swift government action, the bird flu in Turkey has been contained for the time being. 
 People who were in contact with sick birds or with infected persons were given the antiflu drug Tamiflu, as were health workers caring for the ill. 
 The Stockholm-based European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention praised Turkey for its transparent response to the outbreak, saying the government was quick to ask for help and follow WHO guidance. 
 According to the centre, quick identification of the virus in chickens, immediate culling and careful monitoring of people exposed to the virus have all helped contain the bird flu. 
 Children have been found to be at special risk because they are often the ones who care for the birds. 
  Annan, Papadopoulos discuss ways to move Cyprus reunification process forward  01/03/2006 UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos agreed on Tuesday that progress in a number of areas, including technical talks between Cyprus's two communities, would improve the atmosphere enough to revive reunification talks.

 "They lack adequate access to healthcare and education, and are unable to fulfill other elementary living conditions. 
 So far, the city of Belgrade has secured 58 locations for housing and financing for their construction. 
 Countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia thus have the capacity to implement the project more quickly, because they have access to EU funds. 
 Serbia-Montenegro, however, must cope with scarce financial resources and can expect to see much slower progress. 
 Bucharest officials have repeatedly had to ask for the terms to be extended while they seek to boost absorption capacity. 
 The SEE-Network was initiated by the German Federal Foreign Office and InWEnt gGmbH -- Capacity Building International. 
 Any construction work on property owned by Greek Cypriots must cease, the report adds, recommending the initiation of plans for the establishment of mixed population villages wherever possible. 
 Athens should also suspend its Joint Defence Space doctrine, "cease joint military activities with the Greek Cypriots and stop participating in the operations and staffing of the Cypriot National Guard", it says.

 According to the Veterinary Research Institute (IKV), Albania is surrounded by countries affected by bird flu and is on the path of migrating birds. 
 Imports of chicken, livestock and dairy products from countries affected by the disease have been curtailed. 
 Noting that a debate about the 25-nation bloc's enlargement strategy is due in 2006, the foreign ministers also stressed that the EU's "absorption capacity has to be taken into account" in any future enlargement. 
 If enforced, it could have led to the sacking of hundreds of judges implicated in election riggings and show trials carried out by the Milosevic regime, as well as some who were simply incompetent. 
 According to research by the Centre for Democracy and Reconciliation in Southeastern Europe, only one other country in the Western Balkans -- Albania -- has adopted a law on lustration. 
 Leigh also voiced concern over the country's capacity to absorb resources from the European funds that it is set to receive in the future. 
 A brief documentary covering Djindjic's political career was screened, and visitors were shown footage from the assassination. 
 Should goods transport begin, customs and phytosanitary inspections of agricultural products would be carried out at Volkovo, about 10km from the border. 
 Thousands of homes have been flooded and more than 100 villages and towns are without electricity. 
 Rail service between Sofia and Bulgaria's second largest city, Plovdiv, was also temporarily disrupted by the floods, which have also triggered a number of landslides across the country. 
 "We are on high alert," the Greek daily  Kathimerini  quoted Evros Deputy Prefect Michalis Kogioumtzis as telling the Athens News Agency on Tuesday. 
 The Turkish city of Edirne, on the country's border with Bulgaria, has also battling floods. 
 "Edirne's Merich River normally has a flow of 500 cubic metres of water, but after the opening of dams on the Bulgarian Arda River, this flow increased to 1,800 cubic metres, which in turn opened the way to a natural disaster in the city," the Turkish daily  Hurriyet  reported on Wednesday.

 The other four wounded during the incident were still in hospital Thursday, with at least one of them in intensive care. 
 Aslan, who was arrested on Wednesday, carried papers identifying him as an Istanbul lawyer. 
 Police said he had admitted that the attack was in retaliation for a recent court ruling that a schoolteacher should not be promoted to the post of headmistress because she wore the headscarf on her way to and from work. 
 Islamists have often attacked the Council for its strict upholding of Turkey's secular laws, especially the ban on wearing Islamic-style headscarves in universities and public offices.

  Romanian car dealers worry about EU accession  25/05/2006 Despite unprecedented sales, Romanian car dealers are afraid their businesses might be at risk when the country enters the EU.   By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 25/05/06 The car business is booming in Romania. 
 According the Car Producers and Importers Association (APIA), last year Romanians bought 256,000 new vehicles -- 42 per cent more than in the same period in 2004, and almost double for all of 2002. 
 Car prices in Romania are in euros and sometimes dollars, making the vehicles 12 per cent to 18 per cent cheaper. 
 Economic growth has also played a role, as well as the new 1,000-euro state subsidy for those who replaced cars that were 12 or more years old. 
 It was a new car too," says Florin Tarcatu, a 32-year-old sales adviser from Bucharest. 
 Two of my colleagues and three of my neighbours also changed their cars last year and they all bought new vehicles." 
 Despite such encouraging results, most car dealers are looking towards the future with anxiety. 
 Sicre was referring to the way the Polish car market reacted after the EU accession in May 2004, when all import restrictions were abolished. 
 Other new EU members have taken a different path and imposed restrictions on imports of used cars. 
 Officials have to understand they have to protect the local car factories, the environment and the safety of the traffic," said APIA's president, Brent Valmar. 
 Others have suggested a tax should be paid by the importer in accordance with the number of kilometres the car has travelled. 
 Still another idea is to implement regulations similar to those in the Czech Republic, where no car older than eight years can be registered. 
 "Instead of paying 1,000 euros to 1,500 euros for an eight to ten-year-old Dacia, famous for its lack of reliability and safety, I would [rather] give the same money for a Western car which nowadays I can't register in Romania," explains Dan Toader, 48, a farmer from Prahova County. 
 In the first three months of this year, Romanian dealers sold 58,000 new cars, only 4.3 per cent more than in the same period of 2005.

 Unfortunately, the airy Balkan style of football will not be demonstrated this time by teams from Slovenia (one appearance), Bulgaria (six appearances), Romania (seven appearances), and above all Turkey (three appearances). 
 There are five ports in Albania open to international traffic: Durres, Vlora, Saranda, Shengjin and Himara -- with an average of about 5 million tonnes of cargo a year. 
 The government is implementing a master plan for the development of the port -- aiming to improve capacity and efficiency. 
 A Durres Industrial Park is being promoted by the EBRD, and is planned for just outside of the city. 
 It is considered Albania's gate -- not only for the arrival and departure of ships carrying goods, but also for passengers, as it is connected daily with ferries to the Italian ports of Bari (300km away) and Brindisi (200km away).

 With the building of one of three planned oil pipelines, the region could finally start cashing in on its geo-strategic position between the thirsty West and the oil rich East.  By Georgi Mitev-Shantek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 30/05/06 Oil transit from the Caspian Sea Region through the Balkans and into Europe and the United States is so significant that there are plans to build a total of three oil pipelines. 
 Though in principle, Washington supports all projects that could assure better access to Caspian "gold", this pipeline is proving the most interesting. 
 Though this project has enormous advantages over its competitors -- at least twice the capacity, refineries and consumers along its route, partial construction under way, and an existing "pipe-to-pipe" connection to a line that crosses the Alps in Trieste -- its far less advanced than others. 
 Under the ECAA, these rules will be eased, creating more routes for European carriers and enhancing tourism and investment opportunities in SEE. 
 "Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has determined that she cannot certify that the government of Serbia-Montenegro is co-operating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia" (ICTY), State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in a statement. 
 Washington made it clear, however, that Wednesday's move did not mean a suspension of some $62m in humanitarian aid for the Serbian people and assistance for initiatives aimed at strengthening democracy in the country. 
 The extradition of a number of ICTY indictees in early 2005 allowed Washington to certify in June last year that Serbia-Montenegro was co-operating with The Hague court and to continue providing financial assistance to Belgrade authorities. 
 But Washington also noted there has been "little notable co-operation" with the UN tribunal in recent months, and that Serbia must meet its international obligations in order to build closer ties with the United States.

  Privatisation, improved competitiveness top economic agenda for Montenegro  08/06/2006 Tourism, financial services and the construction sector are among the most promising areas for the new state's economic development, despite competitive disadvantages due to seasonal factors, says an IMF representative.  By Antonela Arhin for Southeast European Times � 08/06/06 With Montenegrins having voted to split from the loose union wth Serbia, the economic prospects of the new state are a key topic of interest.

 Pekerman brought in two forwards, the "Brazilians" Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi, probably the most talented young player in the world, to replace Saviola and Rodriguez. 
 All the Chelsea forward had to do was roll the ball home. 
 An Athens-backed Greek Cypriot coup in July 1974, aimed at uniting Cyprus with Greece, was followed by a military invasion by Turkey, which took control over the northern part of the island.

  Teams, coaches from former Yugoslavia build on storied legacy  21/06/2006 Serbia-Montenegro's appearance in the 2006 World Cup marked a disappointing last gasp for the once-proud tradition of Yugoslav football. 
 Luckily, changing names isn't the only thing football in the former Yugoslavia is known for. 
 Starting with the 1930 World Cup in Uruguay, the former Yugoslavia was a significant force in international football. 
 It faced title defender Argentina, playing 60 minutes with one man short after Sabandzovic got a red card marking the great Maradona. 
 In the following years, international sanctions cut Yugoslavia out of world football. 
 Besides Zlatko Kranjcar and Ilija Petkovic, there are also Branko Ivankovic, leading the Iranian team, and Ratomir Gane Dujkovic, who made an excellent selection for Ghana. 
 The success of these coaches is probably the best testament of how strong the Yugoslav school of football once was.

(AP, DPA, BBC, RFE/RL, Makfax, The White House, Washington File - 21/06/06; Official Austrian EU Presidency Web Site) 
 The EU plays an "essential" role in helping strengthen democracy in the Balkans, US President George W. Bush said Wednesday (21 June), pledging Washington's support for efforts to achieve that goal.

 In 1918, Montenegro opened its embassy in Washington, DC. 
 But all that evaporated into nothing, thanks to two handballs by Milan Dudic, a red card picked up by Albert Nadj, and the feisty play of the Ivorians. 
 The Belgrade Red Star striker moved a step to the right, passed off Blaise Kuassi's back and rounded goalkeeper Boubacar Barry. 
 With the match in their pocket, Ivory Coast calmly played possession football, although they lost Doromaud to a second yellow card. 
 Draskovic said Serbia and Montenegro would exchange ambassadors as soon as possible, adding that he and Vlahovic agreed for the principle of reciprocity to be respected. 
 "Montenegro and Serbia are once again together in the capacity and in the way that allows them to be equal and at service to one another, like it has always been in history," Vlahovic said.

 In the 85th minute, the Croats were left with ten men on the pitch, as Simunic received his second yellow card for the night. 
 Simunic may now be inscribed in the FIFA record books as the first player to receive three yellow cards.

 Now authorities are working to create a regional educational programme that can be used jointly by the two countries and the UN-administered province.  By Erlis Selimaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 27/06/06 Education experts from Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia are working to create a unique educational programme for pre-university studies by applying common books and methods -- in science, literature, history and philosophy -- that can be used by the two countries and the province.

  At bars, beaches and even at work, Albanians catch World Cup fever  30/06/2006 Although Albania did not secure a place in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the country's football fans are following the competition with interest.   By Erlis Selimaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 30/06/06 Cafes, bars and restaurants in the Albanian capital are using the World Cup to attract more customers. 
 But this is a game and it is all about luck for the teams," a football fan in Tirana says. 
 Normally, at this time of year, Albanians would have started their holidays, or at least be visiting the seaside on daily basis. 
 But when the sun shines, people along the Adriatic coast combine activities: lying in the sand, swimming in the sea, and making sure not to miss a single minute of the World Cup. 
 Isn't that a brilliant solution: watching soccer games near the seaside?" 
 "I think, at least in the short term, the image and the credibility of Romania in the United States would be affected," says Michael Radu, chairman of the Centre on Terrorism at the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. 
 "Being a small country, with a small market, the capacity of Albania to enter the European markets will increase after the SAA signing. 
 Ledi Bianku, professor of international rights at the University of Tirana and an expert on integration issues, agrees that signing the SAA will benefit Albania, as the country has now obtained privileged status. 
 "Only through a real dialogue of mutual respect and good-faith negotiations can justice become a reality in Kosovo," said a statement issued by the Joint Commission of Orthodox and Catholic Bishops, meeting in Washington.

  SEE blog review  07/07/2006 A weekly roundup of highlights from around the region.  By Balkanblogs for Southeast European Times � 07/07/06 Every city has its unique attractions: cuisine, picturesque sights, galleries and museums -- and in Belgrade's case, a high-tech public parking system.  Desperate Serbwife  lauds the city's innovative approach, which relies on text messaging instead of old-fashioned metres. 
 "When you park your car downtown, you pay for your parking by texting your license plate number to the parking officials and pay via your cell phone bill at the end of the month. 
 You can buy one hour at a time and it's enforced by a metre maid coming along with a handheld computer and typing in your license number -- if your number is not entered, you get a ticket.

  Plans to close High Representative's office raise concerns in BiH  14/07/2006 According to some, the decision on shutting down the top international envoy's office in BiH sends a particular message -- you have elections in October, so consider carefully your choice to lead the country in the future.  By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo � 14/07/06 The international community has decided to close the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on 30 June 2007.

  Water shortages in Croatia hurting tourism  01/08/2006 Lack of adequate infrastructure is leaving some of Croatia's prime tourist locations without enough water, forcing rationing and driving away visitors.  By Kristina Cuk for Southeast European Times in Zagreb � 01/08/06 At the peak of the tourist season, coastal regions of Croatia have been plagued with water shortages. 
 Rainfall in Dalmatia has been scarce, and the existing water supply systems are not adequate for large settlements, nor capable of handling the growing influx of people.

 A leading rights watchdog urged Romania on Wednesday (2 August) to end the discrimination against thousands of HIV-positive children and youth, which leaves many of them without access to schooling, medical care, jobs, or information about their health condition. 
 The 104-page report, released on Wednesday, is based on five months of research completed in June and on individual and group interviews with dozens of HIV-positive Romanian youth. 
 More than 700 of the HIV-positive children live in extended family placements, foster care placements, and institutions run by the state or NGOs. 
 Such measures include ensuring the access of HIV-positive children and youth to appropriate education and medical care -- including medications -- and suitable care for those with mental and physical disabilities. 
 HRW also called for ending mandatory HIV testing as a condition for employment and for measures to ensure that those in foster, extended family and residential care are better prepared for independent living.

 A major contributor to the pollution problem is the large number of cars, most of them old. 
 According to official estimates, there are more than 200,000 cars on the road now, a figure that is rising by about 10,000 annually. 
 About 40,000 of these cars still use leaded petrol. 
 More than 80 per cent of cars are diesel-powered. 
 If not maintained properly, diesel engines emit large quantities of microscopic particles, called PM10s, which can lodge deep in the lungs and are carcinogenic.

 The virus has, however, continued its advance in Asia, particularly in Indonesia, where the first human cases of infection with the H5N1 virus were detected in 2005. 
  Political "tsunami" lashes Romania  22/08/2006 One of Romania's most popular politicians, Mona Musca, is among those affected by the disclosure of communist-era secret police files.  By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 22/08/06 Prominent figures on the Romanian political scene have been falling one by one as the National Council for Research on the Communist Secret Service Archive (CNSAS) started declassifying files of the once-feared Securitate.

 Iro Miro Jovic, the incumbent in the Bosnian Croat seat, is in a neck-and-neck race with Zeljko Komsic of the multiethnic party of the Social Democrats. 
 Researchers at the Alumni Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies, an NGO based in Sarajevo, found that politicians during this campaign devoted an average of 1.5% of their stump speeches to concrete issues. 
 "This would mean ultimate escape of the populist party out of the hardline SDS's shadow," says Nerzuk Curak, a political analyst at the University of Sarajevo. 
 Haris Silajdzic, founder of the moderate Party for BiH and wartime foreign minister and prime minister, is expected to fill the Bosniak seat.

 "The IGF meeting in Athens can be considered a success if a fair proportion of those attending go away with some preconception changed, or, better still, some ideas about how they will work differently in their area of responsibility," Desai wrote in an article the BBC carried on Monday. 
 But the best measure of success is if those who come to Athens choose to come again to the 2007 IGF in Brazil, the 2008 IGF in India and the 2009 IGF in Egypt." 
 The international community has to be extremely careful in how it continues to deal with the region, especially Kosovo."

(Reuters, The Guardian, BBC, EUobserver - 06/11/06; AP, Irish Examiner, Sofia News Agency - 05/11/06; AFP - 04/11/06; AKI, HINA, EurActiv - 03/11/06) 
 Air passengers across the EU are now allowed to carry small quantities of liquids in their hand luggage, under new security rules that took effect on Monday (November 6th). 
 Liquids must be packed in a transparent resealable plastic bag with a capacity of up to one litre. 
 This applies to a range of items, including creams, lotions, hair and shower gels, toothpastes, mascara, lip gloss, perfumes, sprays, drinks, soups and syrups. 
 Travellers will be allowed to carry such items on board. 
 Under a privatisation agreement sealed in October 2004, operational responsibility for airport management was placed in the hands of the Tirana Airport Partners (TAP) consortium. 
 "The new terminal sets standards for Albania and is thus making its own special contribution to the way the capital city is changing." 
 In recent years, Albania has drawn the attention of a number of international carriers. 
  Montenegrin prosecutor says ethnic Albanian group planned terrorist acts  07/11/2006 A group of ethnic Albanians arrested in September had plans to carry out terrorist attacks, Montenegro's top prosecutor said on Monday.  (AP, AKI, RFE/RL - 06/11/06; AP, AFP, DPA, BBC - 10/09/06) 
 Some of the financial support the group received allegedly came from members of the Albanian diaspora in the West, mainly from immigrants in the United States, which helped it secure the weapons, munitions, forged documents and other means needed to carry out the plans. 
 Italian news agency AKI also quoted Medenica as saying the group maintained close ties with former members of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army, with whom it planned to carry out joint terrorist attacks. 
 In Washington, meanwhile, State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the United States still supports reaching a solution in 2006. 
 However, he suggested Washington might back a postponement if called for by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari. 
 He reiterated Washington's support for the efforts of Ahtisaari, who the Serbian government attacked Monday as being pro-Albanian. 
 The envoy is plotting behind Serbia's back to turn over Kosovo to its ethnic Albanian majority, a spokesman for Prime Minister Vojislav Kostinica claimed, demanding that Ahtisaari be replaced and his blueprint for status discarded. 
 The Fund will assume an advisory capacity to help the country along.  By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 08/11/06 This month, Croatia's current arrangement with the IMF comes to a close. 
  New security role emerges for Black Sea region   08/11/2006 Since 1991, the Black Sea has undergone a dramatic transformation. 
 Once embedded within the communist world, it has now become a key point of intersection with considerable geopolitical significance.  Analysis by Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest � 08/11/06 International Black Sea Action Day was marked on October 31st by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. 
 Until 1991, all the Black Sea states except Turkey were in Moscow's sphere of influence. 
 Today, the Soviet Union no longer exists and the 44-year bipolar world order can be found only in the history books. 
 The Black Sea is located at the crossroads of three security spaces -- European, Euro-Asian and Islamic. 
 The terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001 spurred the West to rethink its perspective towards the Black Sea. 
 On October 31st 1996, the six coastal states signed the Black Sea Strategic Action Plan for the Rehabilitation and Protection of the Black Sea, giving regional co-operation an environmental dimension. 
 The Action Plan acknowledges that collective action is required from all Black Sea countries to reduce the impact of pollution on the Black Sea ecosystem, and to ensure a better life for the 16 million people living in the area. 
 Influenced by political and military events, the Black Sea has become transformed into a complicated intersection of geopolitical and geo-economic boundaries, becoming also a framework within which the Euro-Atlantic community asserts itself. 
 As before in history, the Black Sea is becoming once again a zone where opposites meet, overcome segregation and conflict, and work towards reconciliation. 
 Earlier this month, Bulgarian Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov alerted the European Commission (EC) about an earlier than planned reduction in the country's electricity exports due to coal supply problems. 
 "We are reducing the supply of electricity to the region to ensure home consumption and this will inevitably create problems for the countries in the region," the minister said on November 1st. 
 "Bulgaria currently exports electricity to every neighbour," the parliamentarians said, "Even allowing for limited replacement generation by highly polluting lignite plants, power cuts in the region are certain." 
 Parallel with the report, the EC also released a paper on the bloc's capacity to integrate new members. 
 Athens objects to its neighbour's use of the term Macedonia, which it considers to be fundamentally Greek, and has in the past blocked EU recognition of the country and imposed a yearlong embargo, starving the country of vital imports. 
 Sekerinska, who holds a degree in electrical engineeirng from Skopje University, has been a member of the SDSM's central board since 1993 and a member of the party presidency since 1995. 
 Following that, between 1996 and 1998 she was on the City of Skopje Council. 
 The new vice presidents are current MPs Jani Makraduli and Igor Ivanovski, and Strumica Municipality Mayor Zoran Zaev. 
 Prosecutors say they had evidence proving "the existence of threats which gave the victim a profound sense of fear for his life, his family and the development of his career". 
 In the framework of the 2006 CARDS programme, 51m euros in pre-accession assistance has been allocated to BiH. 
 The signatories, affiliated with the European People's Party/European Democrats (EPP/ED) group, included Dimitar Abadzhiev, Maria Kapon and former Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski. 
 However, the process remains highly politicised.  By Blerta Foniqi-Kabashi for Southeast European Times in Pristina � 16/11/06 Contact Group representatives met with the mayors of ten Kosovo municipalities in Pristina on Tuesday (November 14th) to discuss the decentralisation process. 
 "For better functionality of the local administration, we should have strong mayors of municipalities," Kaidanow said. 
 "The local authorities should deal with that which has more importance for the local level of the people, and the mayors of the municipalities should deal more with the issues that have to do with citizens of that locality." 
 Pristina Mayor Ismet Beqiri reiterated such concerns at Tuesday's meeting. 
 According to the mayor, Kosovo's institutions are ready to build democracy, but not at the cost of undermining an independent and sovereign Kosovo. 
 I don't know how it is functional for a village located 1km from the centre to be part of another municipality that is, for example, 20km away," Beqiri said. 
 But according to Gerard Gallucci, the UN administrator in the divided city of Mitrovica, decentralisation "simply means strong local rule in areas in which local people want to control their own lives, whether they're Serb or Albanian". 
 Tariceanu assured him that the project, which is opposed by Greenpeace and other environmental watchdogs, "will be carried out if all international and European environmental criteria" are met. 
 Besides illegal transfer of migrants, some in the group also trafficked luxury cars. 
 Seven days after the groups have begun work and provided they have carried out their initial tasks, a meeting between Papadopoulos and Talat should take place, Gambari suggested. 
 He was born in Sarajevo in 1964 and later graduated from the Sarajevo Faculty of Law and the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington. 
 Cyprus has been split along ethnic lines since 1974, when Turkey deployed thousands of troops in the country's north following a brief, Athens-backed Greek Cypriot coup that sought to unite the island with Greece. 
 In September, part of the contingent was moved from the relatively safe north to the turbulent south, near the city of Kandahar. 
 The city is a centre of Taliban activity and a very dangerous place. 
 The Greek and Russian foreign ministers voiced hope Wednesday (November 22nd) that a long-delayed pipeline project designed to carry Russian oil to Greece via Bulgaria will be officially given the go-ahead by the end of this year. 
 The 285km pipeline is intended to carry Caspian crude oil from the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Burgas to Alexandroupolis on Greece's Aegean coast. 
 A competing project, also involving Bulgaria, is the AMBO pipeline, designed to carry oil from the Caspian region to Burgas and then through Macedonia to Albania's Mediterranean port of Vlore. 
 The new terminal would have an annual capacity of one million passengers. 
 "The terminal will create all the conditions for hundreds and thousands of Albanians and tourists to travel to Italy and other countries of Europe through the sea, and for those who enter Albania from the port. 
 There are five ports in Albania open to international traffic: Durres, Vlora, Saranda, Shengjin and Himara -- with a total average of about 5 million tonnes of cargo annually. 
 The government is implementing a master plan for the development of the port -- aiming to improve capacity and efficiency. 
 A Durres Industrial Park, planned for a location just outside of the city, is being promoted by the EBRD. 
 Durres is considered Albania's gateway -- not only for the arrival and departure of ships carrying goods, but also for passengers, as it is connected daily with ferries to the Italian ports of Bari and Brindisi. 
 With the vote set for January 21st, the parties have been searching for the best way to maximise their chances under Serbia's election law. 
  Lack of electricity leads to rationing in Macedonia  28/11/2006 Macedonia requires twice as much electric power as it produces. 
 The lack of electricity in the region and the cost of production at Macedonian thermo-electric plants are prompting the country to seek long-term answers.  By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 28/11/06 The lack of electricity in Macedonia is causing the country to ration power to large companies this winter. 
 The government has denied allegations that electricity rationing could be imposed on the general public. 
 Macedonian Electric Transmission System Operator (MEPSO), the company responsible for the country's electricity transfer, announced a tender for procurement of 957 MWt hours -- 30% of the total amount of energy Macedonia needs -- by April 2007. 
 For the longer term, the economy ministry says it will announce a tender for the construction of new electricity sources as soon as possible. 
 In carefully prepared remarks, he said Islam has a "great benevolence".

 However, she and EU envoy Stefan Lehne also warned that any outbreaks of violence would only serve to derail the process.  By Blerta Foniqi-Kabashi for Southeast European Times in Pristina � 05/12/06 US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo and the EU's envoy for the Kosovo status talks, Stefan Lehne, arrived in Pristina on Monday (December 4th). 
 "The United States of America strongly supports Ahtisaari and his comprehensive proposal, which will be presented to the parties following the elections in Serbia that will take place on January 21st," DiCarlo said. 
 According to the Macedonian Foreign Ministry, the first phase of the talks will concentrate on a few issues: reducing paperwork for several categories of visa seekers � including students, journalists, researchers, scientific workers, civil servants taking part in seminars or those traveling with official delegations. 
 Palestinian doctor Ashraf Ahmad Jum'a and Bulgarian nurses Valya Chervenyashka, Snezhana Dimitrova, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo and Kristiana Valcheva were arrested 11 months after they arrived in Libya in March 1998 to help care for patients at the Al-Fateh Hospital in Benghazi.

 In return, Turkey reportedly wants the Famagusta seaport and the Ercan airport -- both in Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus -- to be opened to international traffic and trade. 
 The opening of Ercan airport "is out of the question; there's no way the government of Cyprus is going to give its consent to legalising this airport," Greek Cypriot government spokesman Christodoulos Pasiardis told the Bloomberg news agency. 
 During those three years, the state completed significant legislative reforms, most of which were carried out in co-operation with the CoE, its monitoring bodies and other international experts.

 The plan involves the creation of 16 new non-Albanian municipalities that have competency in the areas of education, health care, the media, social affairs, economy and privatisation, the judiciary --up to the level of the municipal court -- and policing. 
 "For better functionality of the local administration, we should have strong mayors of municipalities," Kaidanow said last month. 
 "The local authorities should deal with that which has more importance for the local level of the people, and the mayors of the municipalities should deal more with the issues that have to do with citizens of that locality." 
 According to Gerard Gallucci, the UN administrator in the divided city of Mitrovica, decentralisation "simply means strong local rule in areas in which local people want to control their own lives, whether they're Serb or Albanian". 
 The capital, Tirana, with its brightly painted apartment buildings and with an Italian cafe culture, is a fantastic starting point, especially since it's hard to spend more than $15 a person at the city's nicest restaurants," the review says.

 Southern Albania's greatest treasure, however, is Butrint, a 2,500-year-old city, about 11 square miles, the paper says.

  Macedonian primary health care clinics go private   12/02/2007 A major reform in the Macedonian health care system took place at the start of the year. 
 So far, however, patients notice few changes.  By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje � 12/02/07 Around 1,200 state-run primary health care clinics were privatised in Macedonia on January 1st. 
 In other words, physicians are expected to take better care of their patients in order to keep them from switching to a different clinic. 
 Physicians charge the same fees as before, while the so-called health insurance "blue cards", exempting holders from the full cost of the service, are still valid. 
 A part of the gross salary of every employee in the country is allotted for a single state-run fund, which is responsible for funding the entire health care system. 
 Primary care physicians can treat a maximum of 1,700 patients from each age group, for a monthly compensation of 0.7 euros per patient. 
 If the number of patients is 3,000, then the clinic must have two primary care physicians on staff to ensure an adequate level of care. 
 Around 200 gynecological clinics in the primary health care system have been transformed. 
 On October 30th 2006, Albania and Macedonia signed a protocol on the entrance points of the pipeline -- the Albanian village of Stebleve and Macedonian village of Lakaica.

  International Court of Justice ruling on genocide sparks reactions   27/02/2007 The International Court of Justice exonerated Serbia of responsibility for genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but ruled that it failed to prevent the 1995 genocidal slaughter of Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica.  By Denis D?idi? for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo -- 27/02/07 In a historic verdict on Monday (February 26th), the International Court of Justice ruled that while Serbia failed to comply with its obligation to stop and punish those who carried out the genocide in Srebrenica in July 1995, there was insufficient evidence that Serbia committed, assisted or funded acts of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) during the 1990s conflict. 
 "Now is the time to carefully read the verdict and try to move forward," Serb member Neboj�a Radmanovic said. 
 The apology came in a statement that read, �for the sake of BiH's future ", it was "essential that a deepest apology be extended to the victims, their families and friends, regardless of their ethnicity". 
 The ICJ's verdict on Monday cleared Serbia of direct responsibility for the Srebrenica massacre, but said it had failed to comply with its obligation to stop and punish those who carried out the genocide there. 
  400,000 Roma lack identification in Serbia  01/03/2007 While Serbia rolls out high tech personal ID's and other documents, some 400,000 Roma remain unaccounted for.   By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 01/03/07 Earlier this year, Serbia introduced new high-tech ID cards with chips and biometric data, yet 400,000 Serbian Roma have no identifying documents. 
 According to the new regulation, all citizens over 16, residing in Serbia, must have a new ID card by the end of July 2011. 
 Minister of Internal Affairs Dragan Jocic has said that the new high tech cards will help fight organised crime and terrorism, improve state institutions and can be used to determine voter lists. 
 Out of respect for ethnic minorities' rights, the new registration regulation stipulates that those who observe religious or national customs may have their photo taken while wearing a scarf or hat. 
 The ID cards will be printed in Serbian Cyrillic and English, as well as in the languages of the ethnic minorities. 
 Without an address they cannot register for an ID card, and without an ID card the state administration cannot account for them. 
 Without proper ID, I have no health care coverage, but have to pay for a doctor's visit.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin, Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev and Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis attended the signing cermony in Athens, wrapping up almost 15 years of negotiations on the 279km pipeline. 
 Putin said the 600,000-barrel-a-day pipeline would be filled with oil from new developments in Russia and Central Asia without diverting supplies from other export channels. 
 "Given the increasing density of maritime traffic in the enclosed Black Sea and additional quantities of oil exported from the region, it is of the utmost importance to give a higher priority to the alternative of transporting oil by pipelines," said EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs, expressing international concern over the threat of maritime accidents. 
 Various pipeline options have been in the works for years as oil production expands in the Caspian Sea basin. 
 A similar statement came from State Department spokesman Sean McCormack, who also made clear that Washington still seeks a quick Security Council resolution on Kosovo. 
 The government is now seeking to address the problem by reviving the idea of ID cards, first proposed seven years ago. 
 According to authorities, the ID cards will be issued to citizens over the age of 16. 
 To prevent fraudulent use, the cards will include the owner's fingerprints, a computer chip containing data about the bearer, and an unchangeable identification number.

  Macedonian schools to get 150,000 computers   21/03/2007 The Macedonian government wants to boost computer use in schools, as well as build hundreds of new schools and gyms.  By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 21/03/07 The Macedonian government is making an effort to provide computer access to every primary and secondary school student in the country. 
 In two separate tenders, it plans to provide a total of 150,000 computers to boost information technology skills and promote computer-based education. 
 The government is organising special tutorials to help train teachers in computer-based instruction. 
 "The goal of the project is to enable every student to have a computer on their desk and have access to all subjects taught via the computer," Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said at a March 13th press conference. 
 Statistics suggest that there is one computer per 56 students in Macedonia's schools. 
 Schools in rural environments lack adequate desks and chairs and sometimes have to go without electricity, says one teacher in the village of Zelenikovo, near Skopje. 
 In such conditions, he suggests, it may be premature to worry about computers. 
 Local mayors will be asked to specify the number of schools needed in their respective areas, and will decide where the facilities should be constructed The idea is in part meant to create the conditions for introducing compulsory education, something the Gruevski administration strongly supports. 
  Turkey's EU negotiator reiterates Ankara's commitment to reform  23/03/2007 Turkey will carry out EU required reforms, regardless of its progress in the membership talks with the bloc, Turkey's chief negotiator with the EU, Ali Babacan, pledged during a European tour.

  Washington to emphasise support for Ahtisaari's plan  26/03/2007 Kosovo's potential separation from Serbia will not set a precedent for other breakaway regions, the US State Department said last week.

 "Members of the Armenian-Turkish community tell us that such resolutions would stifle the dialogue they seek and would even raise popular emotions so dramatically as to threaten the progress they have made in Turkey," US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried said in a testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on Europe on March 15th. 
 He also warned that if the legislation were passed, Turkey might respond by closing down the Incirlik air base, a key hub for air cargo shipments for US troops in Iraq. 
 "Our aim is to promote tourism in the city," Deutsche Welle radio quoted Italian consul general Lorenzzo Tomassini as saying. 
 The Health Ministry is researching the cancer rates in Sisak, with final results expected by the end of June.

  Millenia-old boats discovered in BiH  29/03/2007 The remains of two Illyrian pirate ships were found some 8m under water in marshlands near Mostar, according to archeologists.  By Denis Dzidic for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo � 29/03/07 The ancient Illyrians, who flourished in the Western Balkans thousands of years ago, were said to be skilled shipbuilders, sailors and -- most likely -- pirates, but no material evidence of this has been located. 
 In one of the most sensational archeological discoveries in the Balkans in recent years, a Sarajevo University professor and her team say they have found the sunken remains of two Illyrian boats. 
 "They are the first Illyrian boats from this era ever to be discovered," says Dr Snjezana Vasilj. 
 "They stole from Roman and Greek ships, and this is the type of boat they used. 
 In addition to the boats, Vasilj's team found more than 70 artifacts, as well as a Roman spear. 
 Although excavations are currently limited to the boat site, she says the team plans to study a larger area in the future. 
 "Historical records tell us that in the first millennium BC boating and shipping was already developed in the east Adriatic Sea, but boats from that period are an extremely rare thing, and each represents a gem," he told the FENA news agency. 
 One of the issues discussed during a meeting between the two countries' delegations, headed by Sanader and BiH Council of Ministers Chairman Nikola Spiric, concerned the dispute over the use of the southern Croatian seaport of Ploce.

 The main suppliers will join Nokia at the location, forming Nokia Village. 
 Ericsson, Microsoft and Renault have also announced plans to open research, support or design facilities in Romania. 
 Sixty-nine lawmakers in the 81-seat assembly voted in favour of the veto cast by Nebojsa Radmanovic, the Serb representative in the BiH tripartite presidency and its current chairman. 
  DiCarlo voices support for Macedonia's NATO bid, urges consensus on reforms  24/04/2007 Macedonia's ruling and opposition parties will need to work together to bring about needed changes, a senior US official said on Wednesday, stressing that "much work needs to be done."  By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje � 24/04/07 Rosemary DiCarlo, US deputy assistant secretary of state in the bureau of European and Eurasian affairs, visited Macedonia on Monday (April 23rd) for talks with President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. 
 "We have a strong partnership with Macedonia and intend to strengthen it," DiCarlo said. 
 Voicing Washington's support for Macedonia's efforts to obtain a NATO membership invitation in 2008, she urged the country to commit itself to reaching a national consensus on the reform process. 
 For his part, Gruevski said he expected the Allies -- particularly Washington -- to help Macedonia get its NATO invitation. 
 DiCarlo's visit is seen as another sign of support. 
 DiCarlo and Gruevski agreed on the need for a quick resolution. 
 DiCarlo also stressed the regional impact. 
 "After all our research and discussions for the 11th president, our dear Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul has been chosen as candidate for the presidency," Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is also the leader of the AKP, told a party meeting. 
 Born in 1950 in the central city of Kayseri, Gul has a doctorate in economics from the University of Istanbul and has also studied in Britain. 
 His professional career includes more then seven-year service at the Islamic Development Bank in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. 
 A fact that may spark some opposition to his candidacy, however, is the Muslim headscarf worn by his wife, Hayrunisa. 
 Women in secular Turkey are not allowed to wear headscarves in campuses and public office. 
 Press reports said the resignation came after a long telephone conversation between the two men the previous day. 
 "Carla del Ponte is not a particularly sophisticated person. 
 "Croatia should do its utmost to carry out the necessary reforms so that the negotiations can be concluded in time for the European Parliament to give its assent before the next EU parliamentary election in June 2009," the EP said on Wednesday, in a resolution concerning a report on the Balkan country's accession progress in 2006. 
 The Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, citing an anonymous official, said the latest action was carried out in co-operation with Kosovo police, marking the first time the two law enforcement agencies have worked together officially since the UN and NATO assumed control of the province. 
 The AKP, which holds 353 seats in parliament, including the speaker's, appeared confident Thursday that Gul could win a first-round victory Friday, despite the main opposition Republican People's Party's (CHP) planned boycott of the vote. 
 Secularists also fear that following his ascent to the presidency -- a largely ceremonial post, except for key veto power -- the AKP will renew its efforts to lift the existing Muslim headscarf ban. 
 It bars Turkish women from wearing headscarves in campuses and public office. 
 Gul's wife, Hayrunisa, wears the headscarf, as do the wives of Erdogan and Arinc. 
 However, sports fans across Croatia, and indeed across the world, have been gripped by the determination of Janica Kostelic, her brother, Ivica, and their father Ante. 
 In her last junior season, 1996-1997, she won the Topolino and Pinoccio in slalom and giant slalom. 
 Kostelic retires as a triple overall winner in the Federation Internationale de Ski (FIS) World Cup in 2000-2001, 2002-2003 and 2005-2006, and with four Olympic gold and two Olympic silver medals -- Salt Lake City 2002 and Turin 2006. 
  Turkey faces political crisis  30/04/2007 Turkey could face early parliamentary elections if its Constitutional Court annuls Friday's presidential vote, in which the ruling party's candidate narrowly failed to be elected.  (FT, New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian, Independent, Telegraph, Today's Zaman - 30/04/07; AP, AFP, Reuters, DPA, BBC, VOA, FT, RFE/RL - 29/04/07; AFP, DPA, BBC - 28/04/07) 
 Gul was supported by 357 of the deputies in Turkey's 550-seat assembly, falling ten votes short of the required two-thirds majority, and sending the process to a second round of voting, scheduled for Wednesday. 
 While largely a ceremonial post, the presidency carries significant veto and appointment powers. 
 "The Turkish Armed Forces maintain their sound determination to carry out their duties stemming from laws to protect the unchangeable characteristics of the Republic of Turkey. 
  EU, US agree to cut barriers to trade, air transport  01/05/2007 EU and US leaders came out of a daylong summit in Washington on Monday announcing agreements that set the stage for improved co-operation in a number of areas.  (AFP, AP, Reuters, DPA, BBC, Bloomberg, VOA, Washington File, US State Department, Official German EU Presidency website - 30/04/07) 
 The EU and the United States agreed in Washington on Monday (April 30th) to further liberalise air services and to boost economic relations by eliminating barriers to trade and investment. 
 Under the accord, all EU and US airlines will be allowed to fly between every city in the 27-nation bloc and the United States. 
  "Gotovina" to trace the path of war crimes suspect  01/05/2007 A US-made documentary addresses the life and career of Ante Gotovina, the retired Croatian general who faces war crimes charges at The Hague.  By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 01/05/07 The California-based film company Pirate Town Productions is preparing a documentary that will deal with the life and military career of retired Croatian Army Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina.

 The pact, Rice said, will allow the Montenegrin and US armed forces to carry out regular exchanges, training exercises and other co-operation activities. 
 According to Moisiu, the visit carries great symbolism. 
  EU-Russia summit jeopardised  03/05/2007 With tension still high between Estonia and Russia, a summit scheduled for later this month may have to be put on ice.  (DPA, Euronews, New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian, The Times, UPI - 03/05/07; AFP, AP, Reuters, BBC, FT, International Herald Tribune, RFE/RL, Euobserver, Stratfor, US Department of State - 02/05/07) 
 Demonstrators kicked his car and tore the Swedish flag off the vehicle, keeping him blockaded for some 15 minutes. 
 US State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey expressed Washington's concerns "about continuing reports of violence and harassment, including harassment of Estonian diplomatic personnel and premises in Moscow". 
 The key problem is that unemployment data is based on the number of people who register at the employment agency so they can receive health insurance "blue cards". 
 Similarly, farmers often register as unemployed, again for the purpose of getting a blue card. 
 The most recent idea is to have the Health Fund issue the blue cards instead of the Employment Agency. 
 The DS, which was second in the elections, has already conceded the prime minister post to Kostunica, but insists on getting more than half of the ministerial seats in the new cabinet, expected to include at least 21 members. 
 Later this year, citizens will begin seeing new ID cards and drivers' licenses, all as part of a new production system.

 The allowable blood alcohol level is also lower for beginners, and they are only allowed to drive cars with a maximum of 90 horsepower. 
 Restrictions on night driving also apply to beginning motorcycle operators. 
 Those without sufficient experience are prohibited from driving at night a motorcycle with more than 125 cubic cm of volume. 
 "The reform-oriented parties should still give careful consideration to their voters' wishes for a European future and act accordingly." 
 The SRS won the most votes of any one party in Serbia's inconclusive parliamentary elections on January 21st, and now holds 81 of all 250 parliamentary seats.

 It is headed by Safet Orucevic, mayor of Mostar from 1994 to 2001. 
 In a letter marking the award presentation, BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic said that although Mostar's Old Bridge has been rebuilt, the healing of souls in the city needs more time, patience and effort. 
 You, Mr. President, carry this authority more than anyone else, and that is what inspired the Centre for Peace and Multiethnic Co-operation in Mostar to offer you the award." 
 "Mr Nikolic's election is a burden on Serbia's ability to carry out its task." 
 He also appoints governors, ambassadors, police chiefs, university rectors and senior judicial officials. 
 Together, these parties hold 130 of the 250 seats in Parliament. 
 Serifovic secured her country's first award in the competition with the emotional ballad "Molitva" ("Prayer"), scoring 268 points in a 42-nation telephone vote count. 
 The new DSS-DP-G17 government, however, has a combined 130 seats in Parliament, enough to pass the reforms needed for the country's progress towards EU integration. 
 Other priorities, Crvenkovski said, include better utilisation of hydro potential, boosting the supply of oil and gas pipeline and electricity transfer systems, and finding ways to make use of Kosovo lignite for the needs of Macedonia's thermoelectric plant at Bitola. 
  Russia, US agree to tone down rhetoric  16/05/2007 Russia and the United States agreed on Tuesday to moderate their rhetoric in public exchanges, but failed to iron out their differences over Kosovo and US plans to build a missile defence shield in Europe.  (Washington Post, Chicago Tribune - 16/05/07; AP, Reuters, DPA, FT, BBC, US Department of State - 15/05/07) 
 "There are going to be old scars to overcome � There will be times when something like missile defence may hit an old nerve. 
 Characterising Washington's plans to place ten missile interceptors in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic as a threat to Russian national security, Moscow has voiced strong opposition to the project. 
 Voicing Washington's support for Ahtisaari's proposals and a draft Security Council resolution recently introduced by France, Rice said the United States is trying "to find common ground in order to be able to move forward". 
 "It was agreed to search for a solution on Kosovo that would be acceptable for all, but there is no such solution immediately in sight," Lavrov said. 
 Together, these parties command 130 of the 250 seats in Parliament. 
 "This government will carry on with the consistent policy founded on the belief that any kind of unilateral recognition of Kosovo's independence would be the most severe and even a double violation of UN norms," Kostunica said. 
 While Parliament was holding its late hour debate Tuesday, police mounted a search of the Deligrad Hotel in Belgrade, on suspicion that Mladic was there. 
 At least one million computers reportedly were used in the cyber offensive against Estonian government, banking and media websites over the past three weeks, prompting their temporary closure. 
 "This is serious because much of the business of the country is done electronically," NATO spokesman James Appathurai told Bloomberg news agency by telephone on Thursday. 
 The EU commissioner also noted the seriousness of the police search for Mladic in downtown Belgrade on Tuesday. 
 According to the daily  Politika , military police searched the 300 rooms of the Deligrad military hotel, looking for both Mladic and indictee Zdravko Tolimir, considered one of the general's top security aides.

  Romania faces health care crisis   24/05/2007 A high demand for doctors across the EU, coupled with the extremely low wages paid to doctors in Romania, presents a new challenge -- the drain of much needed doctors heading westward.   By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 24/05/07 More than 50% of Romanian doctors and 75% of medical specialists plan to leave the country and continue their practice in Western Europe, a survey by the Iasi County Medical College shows. 
 The Iasi survey also shows that 61% of the doctors described the country's healthcare system reform as stationary, 21% thought that the reform will be ineffective, while only 19% believed that the reform will make a difference. 
 About 48% of doctors say that funding is the main problem with the Romanian medical system, while 40% blame the way in which the health care system is set up. 
 Spain has announced that its health care system is short of nearly 3,000 doctors, and the UK needs 400 dentists. 
 As Romania is a new member state, university degrees are accredited within the EU, which in turn allows the current exodus. 
 EU healthcare is also facing two major issues: the growing number of patients who seek medical treatment abroad, even though it is covered by health insurance in their own country, and a lack of physicians. 
 The Standing Committee of European Medics has said that the EU needs to change its policy concerning the health care system and the migration of the medical professionals, to avoid a bigger crisis. 
 It is considered Albania's gate -- not only for the arrival and departure of ships carrying goods, but also for passengers -- as it is connected daily with ferries to the Italian ports of Bari and Brindisi. 
 There are five such ports open to international traffic: Durres, Vlora, Saranda, Shengjin and Himara -- with an average of about 5m tonnes of cargo a year. 
 "What is more specific about Eastern and Central Europe, Central Asia -- I mean the former communist countries -- is that judicial corruption is much higher [there] than in many other parts of the world, which is an interesting finding of this report," Miklos Marschall, TI's director for Europe and Central Asia, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

 The best way for dealing with the problem without jeopardising peace in the border region is through US, Turkish and Iraqi co-operation, officials in Washington have said. 
 Not only will damage sustained over the years be fixed, but the bridges will be enabled to withstand twice their current capacity. 
 The projects will contribute to establishing a sound road infrastructure, boosting Macedonia's capacity to join the European road network, said Transport and Communication Minister Mile Janakievski. 
 For the time being, traffic on the Skopje-Veles Highway has been reduced from two lanes to one, resulting in a few car accidents. 
 Upon completion, expected in 2013, the motorway will form an important section of the Romanian national highway system, providing a vital connection with the rest of the continent, and linking major European market centres with those in Central Asia. 
 Another project -- to build a highway linking Bucharest with the harbour city of Constanta on the Black Sea -- is continuing. 
 Future projects under consideration include a highway linking the western border checkpoint of Nadlac to Bucharest, via the city of Timisoara. 
 There are also plans for a route linking the northern town of Suceava to the Ukrainian city of Cernauti, connecting the 4th and the 5th pan-European highways.

 With the ruling VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition controlling 68 of the 120 seats in Parliament, Gruevski said he had no fears that his government would survive the no-confidence vote, which is expected on Thursday. 
 In a poll last month by the Croatian branch of the GfK Group, one of the top five market research organisations in the world, 52% out of 1,000 respondents said they backed Croatia's NATO bid, up from 43% in March. 
 According to President Alfred Moisiu, the visit carries great symbolism. 
 "The United States, through the Adriatic Charter -- a model in which Washington has played a major role -- has shown that it supports Albania's membership in NATO. 
 The visit also carries a message for the Albanian nation, demonstrating that the country is moving towards democracy," Islami added. 
 Cost was the main reason, as well as a general belief that regular research into agriculture is sufficient to meet the needs of the sector.

  Polish, US leaders determined to move ahead on missile shield project  17/07/2007 Defence co-operation, including the deployment of anti-missile facilities in Eastern Europe, topped the agenda of talks between US President George W Bush and his Polish counterpart, Lech Kaczynski, in Washington on Monday.  (The Washington Post - 17/07/07; AP, Reuters, DPA, International Herald Tribune, Bloomberg, The White House - 16/07/07) 
 The project "is aimed at defence of our democracies against the countries who might have, or already do have, nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction", Kaczynski said after talks with US President George W Bush in Washington. 
 "There's no better symbol of our desire to work for peace and security than working on a missile defence system � that would provide security for Europe from single or dual-launched regimes that may emanate from parts of the world where leaders don't particularly care for our way of life and are in the process of trying to develop serious weapons of mass destruction," Bush said. 
 Speaking to The  Washington Post  on Monday, Kaczynski described Moscow's decision as alarming, and said he asked Bush for assistance in ensuring Poland's protection against future threats.

  Youth unemployment becoming a serious concern in Southeast Europe   17/07/2007 The current unemployment levels in Southeast Europe could become a social issue for the region, where too many young people are out of school and out of work.  By Georgi Mitev-�antek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 17/07/07 In a rapidly changing economic environment in Southeast Europe, many university graduates are unemployed.

 But will it gain enough seats to elect a president?  By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times --19/07/07 Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is widely expected to win a landslide victory in Sunday's (July 22nd) elections. 
 However, the party may not get enough votes to secure three-fourths of the 550 seats in Turkey's parliament � the amount needed to elect a new president. 
 The party hopes to win as many as 20 seats. 
 The Verso poll suggests parliament could have the following distribution: 325 seats for the AKP, 120 seats for the CHP-Democratic Left alliance, 70 seats for the MHP, and 35 seats going to independents � mainly ethnic Kurds. 
 It was the fragmentation of the centre-right that allowed the AKP to conquer two-thirds of the seats in parliament in 2002, even though it only received 34% of the vote. 
 The festival began as a form of protest against the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, but soon grew into one of the leading music events in Europe.   By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 20/07/07 The 8th EXIT festival featured about 150,000 music fans, 28 stages, and four wild nights in Novi Sad, a city 80km north of Belgrade. 
 This translates to 340 seats in the 550-member parliament, enough for the AKP to once again form a single-party government. 
 It is short however of the 413 seats needed to claim three-fourths of parliament, elect a new president and change the constitution. 
 AKP currently holds 352 seats. 
 It will lose seats despite winning a bigger percentage of the vote because two other parties, and a number of individuals, also made it into parliament. 
 The other two parties to cross the 10% threshold are the Republican People's Party (CHP), which received 20.8%, or 111 seats, and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which received 14.2%, or 71 seats. 
 Twenty-four pro-Kurdish independents also won seats, and are expected to form the first pro-Kurdish political group in the assembly since the early 1990s. 
 The deputy chief of the ruling Democratic Party received 85 votes from the 140-seat parliament -- one more than the required constitutional minimum -- after some members of the Socialist-led coalition broke ranks and ignored a boycott that had scuttled earlier rounds. 
 The close of the case paves the way for the full normalisation of Libya's relations with the EU, which also pledged Tuesday to implement "an improved framework to ensure the care dispensed to the children victim of AIDS in Libya".

 The event began with a special plenary session of the country's 140-seat parliament and continued at Tirana's Palace of Brigades. 
 A 50-year-old biologist and researcher who once served as agriculture minister, Topi is deputy leader of Albania's ruling Democratic Party. 
 Given the current disagreements, US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack appeared sceptical Wednesday about the prospects of a deal. 
 "After returning to Bulgaria, the medics began to carry out the sentences imposed in Libya according to the Bulgarian law," said Velchev.

  Bulgarian tourism sector faces possible negative impact of over construction  13/08/2007 Owners of hotels on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast could face bankruptcy next year, the head of the Balkan country's tourist agency has warned.

 A construction spree along Bulgaria's Black Sea coast in recent years has resulted in supply far outweighing demand, with many hotel beds now empty in the peak of the season. 
 Millions of euros have been invested in the construction of hotels, bars and other tourism facilities, but the needed infrastructure is missing, Marin Neshkov, a Bulgarian tourism expert in the northern Black Sea city of Varna, told the German media site.

 Such evidence could also be helpful in tracing the evolution of homo sapien, which is believed to have originated in Africa around 200,000 years ago and migrated later to Europe and Asia.

 Last week, he hosted the 3rd European Ecumenical Assembly, a meeting attended by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, Metropolitan Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church, Cardinal Kasper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, among others. 
 His views were echoed by Kirill, who emphasised the need "to give back a soul to Europe" and by Cardinal Kasper who asked the European Christians "to eventually wake up".

 European gas and electricity giants would be forced to break up under a package of measures the European Commission (EC) proposed on Wednesday (September 19th), in a bid to ensure more competition within the bloc's energy market. 
 The proposed reforms, which require approval by the governments of the 27 EU-member states and the European Parliament, call for the separation of network operation of electricity and gas from supply and generation activities. 
 The same "ownership unbundling" requirement would apply to companies from countries outside the 27-nation bloc, such as Russia, seeking to buy a controlling stake in gas pipelines or electricity power grids. 
 Implementation of these measures is expected to ensure a real and effective choice of suppliers and to lower the prices of electricity and gas for consumers.

  Turkish prime minister's call to end headscarf ban sparks controversy  21/09/2007 A call to lift the ban on headscarves in universities as part of the new constitution has the opposition accusing the ruling AKP of trying to erode secular traditions.  By Ahmet Gormez for Southeast European Times - 21/09/07 Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan sparked controversy earlier this week by calling for an end to the ban on wearing headscarves in universities. 
 Under the existing constitution, it is illegal for women to wear headscarves in state-funded institutions such as hospitals and universities. 
 The prime minister, whose wife and daughters cover their hair with an Islamic style headscarf, said the headscarf is not a political symbol. 
 "I am 100% convinced that the ban on headscarves is an anti-democratic practice," Serif Mardin, a prominent liberal sociologist, told Turkish daily  Hurriyet . 
 After the announcement Tuesday, university rectors -- one of the strongest sectors of Turkey's secular establishment -- called an "urgent" meeting with the head of Turkey's Board of High Education, Professor Erdogan Tezic. 
 "We always knew that the AKP wanted to lift the ban on headscarves, but democracy is as much about style as it is about institutions. 
 Joined by KFOR troops, the KPS sealed off the area and opened an investigation, but details about the type and amount of explosives have not been made available.

 Erdogan's call last week for an end to the ban on wearing the Muslim headscarf in universities has already sparked debate. 
 This summer, the public faced up to 12 hours of power cuts a day, at the peak of the tourism season. 
 The authorities have given the go-ahead for a thermal plant in the southwestern port city of Vlora. 
 As the entire city area of Vlora is 1,120 hectares, and the industrial zone will be located 1.5 km from the centre within a residential area, residents are worried about the negative impact on social life and on the tourism potential. 
 "Despite the government's assurances that the power plant should provide a remedy to the increasingly acute energy situation in Albania, there are indications that the fulfillment of Albania's energy demand features only as secondary to the export of electricity to the European energy market, particularly the Italian market," says Aleksander Mita, representative of the Alliance for the Protection of Vlora Gulf. 
 The plant is expected to have a production capacity of 97 megawatts. 
 At the moment, Albania can only meet half its electricity needs.

 Karadzic appears to have "disappeared from the radar screen", although new books and poetry written by him continue to be published in Serbia, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said in June.

  Greek politics another obstacle in Macedonian name dispute  09/11/2007 The most recent elections left Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and his government with a weaker mandate, further complicating efforts to resolve the name issue.  By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 11/09/07 The need to resolve the longstanding dispute over the name "Macedonia" has become increasingly urgent because of the upcoming NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008. 
 Karamanlis's New Democracy (ND) party now has only a slim majority in parliament -- 152 out of 300 seats. 
 And polls show that around two-thirds of Greeks object to any name for its northern neighbour that includes the word "Macedonia", according to the  Athens News . 
 The results of a poll last year of medical students at the University of Tirana revealed that by the fifth year, 90% were regular smokers. 
 Both countries are proving tough bargainers, with Greece prepared to exercise its power within the EU and NATO, and its neighbour banking on getting enough international recognition to put pressure on Athens.

 The venture caps a year of expansion for Delta Holding, the third largest company in Serbia, behind the state-owned oil and electricity suppliers, and one of the top five in the region. 
 "The announcement of such news just a day before the opening of Delta's biggest investment -- the Delta City shopping mall -- clearly shows that this is a carefully planned and designed campaign aimed at destroying the company's reputation," it said in a statement.

  Report: conditions harsh for disabled in Serbia  21/11/2007 A new report says the disabled are forced to spend years in institutions without proper care and in conditions amounting to torture.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 21/11/07 The Serbian government has reacted angrily to a new report that claims children and adults with special needs are being abused in Serbia's social care institutions, with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica describing the allegations as "malicious". 
 Children are being restrained in their beds, denied adequate medical care, forced to use their beds as toilets and go without heat during winter, MDRI said. 
 "Filthy conditions, contagious diseases, lack of medical care and rehabilitation, and a failure to provide oversight renders placement in a Serbian institution life-threatening," the report said. 
 "If a person or organisation first goes public and says that they have been researching a problem in a country for four years, without having any contacts with that country's official institutions, then that does not seem compassionate, but more like political abuse," Milosavljevic said. 
 A national plan for a mental health care strategy has been adopted, and a bill on the protection of rights of people with mental disorders is now being prepared.

 A prominent analyst on the Balkans suggested on Monday, however, a possible change in Athens' position. 
 In an effort to alleviate the country's chronic energy crises, the government is looking into new options   By Jonilda Koci and Sami Neza for Southeast European Times in Tirana � 28/11/07 Albania receives 95% of its electricity from hydroelectric power plants (HPP), but a drought this year affected reservoirs levels and the plants cannot meet continually rising energy demands.

 The visits of General Bantz Craddock, commander of US forces in Europe; General David Petraeus, head of US forces in Iraq, and General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, came only two weeks after a key meeting in Washington between US President George W. Bush and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on November 5th. 
 PKK violence in Turkey peaked between 1993 and 1995, as the group carried out massive attacks against the armed forces. 
 Turkey, however, was able to carry out effective counterinsurgency operations and the threat was contained. 
 At the same time, lawmakers from the pro-Kurdish party DTP have won seats in parliament for the first time in years. 
 "These attacks aim at provoking Turks against the Kurds, and undermine the inclusion of the DTP party in Turkey's political system," says Sedat Laciner, director of the International Strategic Research Organisation in Ankara. 
  Species of Adriatic fish threatened with extinction   04/12/2007 Fishing overexploitation, pollution and global warming may result in roughly 100 of the 434 fish species in the Adriatic Sea becoming endangered, according to local experts.  By Ivo Scepanovic for Southeast European Times in Split � 04/12/07 There has been an obvious reduction of fish species in the Adriatic if today's species are compared with those of ten, 20 or 30 years ago, experts warn. 
 "The entire Croatian fishing industry depends on small blue fish," says Dr. Alen Soldo of the University of Croatia. 
 According to the head of Croatia's Fishing Authorities, Ivan Katavic, the country has 3,692 commercial fishing ships and boats that catch 52,000 tonnes of small blue fish annually. 
 The end of the political crisis paves the way for Spiric -- who resigned last month but still serves in a caretaker capacity -- to again take up his post. 
 The party, led by Sofia Mayor Boyko Borisov, said it was inviting the four organisations that are members of the European People's Party (EPP) -- the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), the Union of Free Democrats and the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union -- as well as the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (VMRO) to talks on a co-operation agreement.

  Turkey and Greece agree to develop military rapprochement   10/12/2007 Turkey and Greece have agreed to further develop confidence-building measures with new steps in military co-operation after a recent meeting of the countries' foreign ministers.   By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 10/12/07 Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan and his Greek counterpart, Dora Bakoyannis, met in Athens on December 4th for talks that resulted in agreements on multiple military measures between the two countries. 
 The two NATO allies stopped just short of going to war in 1987 and 1996 over oil and gas exploration and a sovereignty dispute involving two tiny, barren islets in the Aegean Sea. 
 Ankara and Athens have held 36 rounds of exploratory talks since 2002 to overcome their disagreements about airspace and territorial waters in the Aegean. 
 In 2006, the two countries decided to establish a direct telephone line between the military chiefs of staff, a hotline between the operational headquarters of the two countries' air forces and a month's extension of a moratorium on military exercises in the Aegean. 
  Del Ponte says Serbia deliberately failing to arrest Karadzic, Mladic  11/12/2007 UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte urged the Security Council on Monday to leave the ICTY open until top indictees, including Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, have been arrested.   (AFP, The New York Times - 11/12/07; AP, Reuters, DPA, FT, BBC, VOA, Beta, UN, ICTY - 10/12/07) 
 Outgoing chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte accused Serbia on Monday (December 10th) of deliberately failing to apprehend the two most wanted fugitives from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s. 
 "Despite the Serbian authorities' declared commitment to fully co-operate with my office and improved procedures, there is no clear roadmap, no clear plan in the search for fugitives, no serious leads and no sign that serious efforts have been taken to arrest the fugitives," del Ponte said in her final address to the UN Security Council on Monday. 
 The tape even failed to stir interest in Turkey, where operatives linked to al-Qaeda carried out deadly attacks four years ago. 
 "It might have negative consequences on the negotiations process," he said.  By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 11/12/07 Despite warnings last week from the EU, Croatian fishermen on Friday (December 7th) insisted that the country proceed with the controversial fishing zone in the Adriatic Sea. 
 The zone, which will cover 57,000 square kilometres, will protect stock in the sea, which Croatian fishermen say is being depleted by Italy's larger fishing fleet. 
 A law passed by the Croatian parliament years ago that establishes a protected fishery and ecological zone in the Adriatic Sea is expected to be implemented on January 1st 2008. 
 Italy and Slovenia oppose the protected fishery area because their ships could not exploit the richer, Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea anymore without special permission. 
 The proposed 900km pipeline would run under the Black Sea via Bulgaria, delivering 30 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas annually to Austria, Slovenia and Italy. 
 Additionally, the deputy attorneys' terms are now permanent and the justice minister received a seat on the council of attorneys.

  Romanian road infrastructure: the deadliest and costliest in Europe  13/12/2007 The odds of dying in a car accident in Romania are 40 times higher than the EU average, a recent report warns, citing reasons that include Romanian drivers' inability to drive defensively and poor roads.  By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 13/12/07 Romania enacted legislation in late November banning horses and carts on all main roads in an effort to reduce the number of accidents occurring. 
 The government needs to take action because Romania has the highest number of deadly car accidents in Europe. 
 Those who use horses and carts depend on them for many functions, such as for travel, to plough fields, and to carry items to sell at market. 
 Action does need to be taken, however, as one person dies in every three car crashes in Romania. 
 According to the latest report on traffic safety from the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Romanians had 6,860 car accidents resulting in 2,418 deaths in 2004. 
 Experts believe the large number of deadly car accidents is a result of Romanian drivers' inability to drive defensively, bad roads, the highways that -- while few in number -- often involve head-on car crashes. 
 SAR warns that politically motivated top management changes within CNADNR and low implementation capacity of the projects doesn't make better and safer roads in Romania likely soon. 
 According to the Croatian constitution, to get a mandate or form the government, a party or a coalition needs to get support from at least 77 deputies of the 153-seat assembly. 
 Sanader's HDZ won 66 seats at the November 25th vote -- 11 seats short of a parliamentary majority. 
 However, the party has reportedly secured the missing seats -- and a second term as prime minister -- by winning over the Farmers' Party and the Liberal Party (HSS/HSLS), along with several minority representatives and the sole representative of the Pensioners' Party. 
 "I have given the mandate to form the government to Ivo Sanader because he has given me guarantees and convinced me that he has the support of more than 77 deputies in the Croatian Parliament," Mesic said Saturday, after he spoke with all the political leaders whose parties won parliamentary seats.

  With handshakes, Serb and Albanian families return to their homes   19/12/2007 Despite uncertainty about the future of Kosovo's status, some displaced families are returning to reconstructed and improved homes.   By Blerta Foniqi-Kabashi for Southeast European Times in Fush� Kosovo � 19/12/07 Thirty Serb and 4 Albanian families came back to their homes in the villages of Nakarade and Lismar in Fushe Kosovo on December 11th. 
 To complete talks on the two chapters, Turkey must implement a number of measures to bring its legislation in line with EU standards and norms in those areas, as well as take steps to improve the institutional and administrative capacity of some of its structures. 
 Kosovo represents a unique case, he told the Security Council, adding that the ethnic cleansing campaign carried out by Serbia in the 1990s has made it impossible for Kosovo Albanians to countenance any form of rule by Belgrade. 
 "Words, commitments and promises need to be put into practice, reform of the justice system and public administration needs to be carried out. 
 Tourist agencies say Austrian ski villages are overwhelmed with Croatian guests, while the number of those travelling to France and Italy has slowly been decreasing.

 "They all frighten us, but I think it (violence) is much less probable than before," he said."Even though everyone's scaring us with these things, I think it's a lot less likely than it was in 2004 after March 17th," he said. 
 Croatian citizens can still travel to Slovenia using only their ID cards, as was the case before. 
 However, they must now fill out a separate card with personal data and receive a stamp from the border control. 
 Fingerprint scanners, cameras and a new computer infrastructure have been put in place so that border police can easily identify and verify the identities of travellers. 
  Macedonia seeks to boost computer use  27/12/2007 Vouchers, IT training and free dialup are some of the services the government is providing in order to strengthen Macedonia's presence in the digital world. 
 However, obstacles remain.  By Goran Trajkov for Southeast European Times in Skopje � 27/12/07 To increase the number of computer and internet users in Macedonia, the government has been implementing a programme called "Macedonia: Country of Computer Experts". 
 The country currently has few computer and internet users, mostly because of low living standards and the high cost of computers and internet use. 
 In its first phase, university seniors were given vouchers worth 200 euros. 
 They were able to use these towards a computer purchase. 
 The vouchers were redeemable at any registered computer store, but had to be used by December 15th. 
 Many could not afford to pay the difference between the value of the voucher and the actual cost of the computer. 
 While a secondhand computer and monitor can be purchased for 200 euros, the vouchers were only valid for new computers. 
 A better approach, the students argue, would be for the vouchers to cover the full price of the cheapest computer available. 
 A similar campaign, aimed at acquiring 150,000 personal computers for elementary schools and high schools in the country, was launched in September. 
 Its higher score reflects an increase in its GDP per capita of about $600 and a 0.1% improvement in its combined gross enrollment ratio for primary, secondary and university education, at 70.1% this year. 
 It has the highest combined gross enrollment ratio for primary, secondary and university education (99%) and, with a GDP per capita of $23,381, Greece has the highest GDP among countries in the region. 
 Romania, which joined the EU on January 1st, 2007, along with Bulgaria, is again ranked 60th with an overall score of 0.813, reflecting its lower indices for life expectancy, adult literacy and combined gross enrollment ratio for primary, secondary and university education. 
  December marks spending peak in Croatia  28/12/2007 As in many countries around the world, Croatians spend more money during the last month of the year.  By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb �28/12/07 At the end of each year, analyses by financial experts at notable institutions, such as the Croatian Market Research Institute (GfK), show that spending by the Croatian public peaks in December. 
 "Croatians love spending in December and complaining they are poor in January," analysts said at the height of the Christmas shopping season. 
 Shopping trend studies suggest Croatians tend to pay with credit cards instead of cash, and use every opportunity to extend the period of payments or divide the payments into regular monthly installments. 
  Port workers in Greece again strike against privatisation plan  01/02/2008 Opposing the government's plans to privatise terminals, workers at the two main commercial ports in Greece started a 48-hour strike on Wednesday.   By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens � 01/02/08 Workers in two of Greece's main ports -- Piraeus and Thessaloniki -- launched a 48-hour strike on Wednesday (January 30th) against the government's decision to privatise container terminals.

  Turkey allows Islamic headscarves at universities   11/02/2008 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed parliament's vote as a triumph for democracy, but Turkey's secularists see it as a threat to the separation of religion and state.  By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times � 11/02/08 Parliament voted on Saturday (February 9th) to allow Islamic headscarves at universities, handing a victory to the Islamist-rooted ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
 On Monday, women wearing headscarves were allowed entry to universities in the cities of Kocaeli, Adana and Diyarbakir, even though the legislation -- which requires the signature of President Abdullah Gul -- had not yet come into force. 
 Turkey's secularists -- who include the still-powerful army, the judiciary and academics -- see the headscarf as a symbol of political Islam, a growing movement in Turkey that opposes strict separation of state and religion. 
 Opponents say lifting the ban will increase social pressure on women to wear the headscarf, especially in small cities. 
 The army has remained silent during the latest debates, but senior judges and university rectors condemned the changes as "unconstitutional". 
 "I am concerned that this current heated debate in Turkey might lead from lifting the prohibition to a moral pressure for women to wear the headscarf in universities," Ria Oomen-Ruijten said. 
 All women in Iran, including foreigners, are obliged in public to wear a headscarf, Biriya reminded reporters. 
 The headscarf ban at Turkey's universities dates back to the 1980s. 
 "The European court has no right to speak on this issue of headscarves. 
 According to reports, up to 2,000 people, most of them university students, joined Monday's rally, dubbed "No Alternative to Europe". 
 But Srdjan Darmanovic, dean of the political science department at the University of Montenegro, says it makes sense for Djukanovic to be prime minister again because he is head of the ruling party. 
 The Sarajevo-based Alumni Centre for Inter-Disciplinary Studies (ACIPS) recently compiled research showing that if a referendum were held, 79% of BiH citizens would vote for EU membership. 
 "The trial cannot proceed in a healthy manner because documents containing information on more than 6,000 telephone calls made by some of the defendants have been destroyed by security officials in Trabzon," Lawyer Erdal Dogan said.

 "It is a political pipeline designed to counter Nabucco," says Alan Riley from London's City University. 
 "So far, the Split Fair has helped promote the city of Split, which, in turn, boosts the city's economy," says Mayor Ivan Kuret. 
 RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, who has been criticised for similar secessionist statements in the past, said on Thursday that the entity must weigh its response to Kosovo's declaration of independence "very carefully". 
  Presidential election rekindles hopes for revived Cyprus peace efforts  18/02/2008 The outcome of Sunday's presidential election in Cyprus, which sent a conservative former foreign minister and a communist leader to a runoff on February 24th, was seen as a signal of Greek Cypriots' readiness for new peace talks with the Turkish Cypriot community.

 Stressing "the fundamental principle of the inviolability of diplomatic missions," Panama's Ambassador Ricardo Alberto Arias, whose country currently chairs the 15-nation council presidency, urged the Serbian government to take the appropriate steps to ensure foreign embassies are protected. 
 US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns called Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic to express Washington's objections. 
 "The message was very clear that the situation was intolerable" and that Serbia should take urgent steps "to provide adequate security forces so that our embassy compound and our personnel were not under attack", State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters Thursday. 
 "We are interested in a political dialogue with the Serbian government," he also said, noting that no disagreement between Belgrade and Washington could serve as "an excuse or justification to incite others to violence". 
 The latest survey by the Croatian Market Research Institute suggests that three out of four Croatian households have significant trouble with their monthly budget. 
 Household utilities -- electricity, gas, heating and water -- are 16% of the average budget. 
 The offensive began amid growing public pressure and a months-long debate among Ankara, Washington and Baghdad. 
 The Turkish Armed Forces codenamed its ground offensive "Gunes", or "Sun", after a three-year-old girl whose father, a corporal, was killed by the PKK during operations in the Gabar mountains last October. 
 The Turkish General Staff did not reveal the exact number of forces in northern Iraq, but stressed this is a mission carried out mainly by the Special Forces to purge the area of PKK terrorists. 
 Turkey's Armed Forces have carried out four major ground operations against PKK targets in the region in the last 16 years, most recently in 1997. 
  Britain heads EU's Albania police mission  26/02/2008 Britain voiced hope on Monday that its leadership of the EU Police Mission to Albania over the next three years will help improve the Balkan country's capacity to fight crime.   (British government, Balkan Insight, AFP, AP, DPA - 25/02/08) 
 The PAMECA project was launched in December 2002 as a continuation of previous EU-assisted efforts aimed at reinforcing the operational capacity of the Albanian police following massive civil unrest in 1997. 
 Operating on a budget of 5.5m euros over the next three years, Britain said it would focus on enhancing the institutional and operational capacity of the Albanian police and enabling them to professionally and accountably investigate and counter criminal activities, notably organised crime. 
  Macedonia, Greece prepare to respond to name dispute proposal  26/02/2008 Macedonia and Greece are working towards defining their positions regarding UN envoy Matthew Nimetz's latest proposal to resolve the longstanding name dispute.  By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 26/02/08 The governments of Greece and Macedonia are preparing responses to UN envoy Matthew Nimetz's set of solutions to the name dispute between the countries, which he proposed in Athens on February 19th. 
 "The offer is a complex and seeks compromise," Nimetz said after the Athens meeting. 
 Earlier this month, UN envoy Matthew Nimetz, who is tasked with helping Athens and Skopje find a solution to their 17-year-old dispute, presented a set of possible solutions to both sides. 
 Thaci made the statement during a visit to the central village of Racak, where Serbian forces killed Kosovar Albanians in 1999 before NATO intervened. 
 "Flexibility, adaptability, perseverance and tenacity have been prominent features of the Stability Pact's approach and success. 
 The council also decided that the Office of the High Representative (OHR) will remain in the country and continue to carry out its mandate under the Dayton Agreement. 
 I do not expect any further protests or movements that might have the capacity to destabilise the country." 
 The law on diplomatic immunity was presented by Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who said that Kosovo -- as an independent state � urgently needs functional laws on its books. 
 "In this way, the primary goals of the land operation have been completed, with Turkish troops returning on the morning of February 29th, 2008 to military bases in Turkey after completing final searches."

 Speaking at a press conference Thursday in Washington, US President George W. Bush said Turkey should end the incursion as soon as possible. 
 More than 7sq km of the city's historic district underwent demolition and more than 40,000 people were relocated to make space for the building. 
 The hall is 1,200 sq m and boasts one of the largest carpets in the world, requiring 35 men to roll it up. 
 The primary mission of the event's organisers has been ensuring the attendees' security, so the country has done everything from sealing off streets and deploying trained snipers to catching stray dogs. 
 Roughly 300 minivans and 100 buses will shuttle attendees to and from the summit and almost 500 cars will be used for the official motorcades, 70 of which will be armored. 
 Additionally, trash cans have been dismantled and sewers sealed along motorcade routes. 
 An 80m stretch of the street lies in the no-man's land separating the city's Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sectors. 
 Cyprus has been split along ethnic lines since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the island to quash a brief Athens-backed coup aimed at uniting it with Greece. 
 Also attending the ceremony were Greek Cypriot Presidential Commissioner George Iacovou, the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot mayors of Europe's last divided capital, Eleni Mavrou and Jemal Metin Bulutoglulari, as well as UN officials and diplomats.

  Serbia to sign energy deal with Russia after May elections  04/04/2008 Ratification of Serbia's multibillion-euro energy co-operation agreement with Russia has been put on hold until at least next month, as pro-Western ministers in the country's caretaker government blocked its approval Thursday.   (AP, Reuters, RIA Novosti, Balkan Insight, Beta, B92 - 03/04/08)

 The Institute of Oceanography and Fishing in Split, Croatia, and the Institute of Marine Biology in Kotor, Montenegro, collaborated on a brochure about 28 species that have been discovered recently in the Adriatic. 
 The Croatian institute had more information because more of the new species were caught and researched there, so we asked it for help," said Joksimovic. 
 His institute plans to search for more new species in the Adriatic, as global warming is expected to influence sea life further in the next ten years. 
 "Sea temperatures in the Adriatic last summer reached up to 30 degrees Celsius. ... 
 The appearance of fish such as blunthead puffer that prefer warmer seas confirms the impact of global warming," he said. 
 "The process of Albanian integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures will be intensified," Topi said during a meeting with US Ambassador to Albania Jon Withers, additionally promising to carry out "electoral reform and an uncompromising fight against corruption and organised crime".

 It will carry 30 billion cubic m of Russian natural gas to Europe annually. 
 It would transport annually up to 30 billion cubic m of gas from Central Asia and the Caspian to the EU via Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria, covering perhaps 5% of Europe's needs. 
 Development Minister Folias's remarks to Reuters came just days after US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza told reporters in Athens last week that he and Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis had "talked about how important it is to put in place diversification options before deepening dependence in one direction, on a single company that's already such a major supplier ". 
 Last year, Greece and Bulgaria reached a deal with Russia on the construction of a 285km pipeline meant to carry Russian oil to the Mediterranean. 
 In the book, the bridge spans not only a river but the city's religious gulf as well, yet it can serve the latter purpose only imperfectly.

 But analysts say that if the pro-Western parties can convince swing pro-European voters that the SAA has no effect on Kosovo's status, they might carry the elections. 
 Concluding the accord should reduce the confusion of some voters about Serbia's relations with the EU after Kosovo's independence, AFP quoted Strategic Marketing researcher Svetlana Logar as saying "The biggest confusion was caused by the status quo, and in this way a clarification of the situation is useful" to the pro-Western forces.

 The SRS trailed with 29.36% and 77 seats. 
 But, as neither Tadic's coalition nor the SRS managed to secure an outright 126-seat parliamentary majority, both seek coalition partners. 
 The fourth-place finisher -- a coalition led by the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), formerly headed by Milosevic, which won 7.6% of the vote and will take 20 parliamentary seats -- is the perceived kingmaker. 
 The coalition between outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia and New Serbia, which took third with 11.59% voter support, translating into 30 seats, signalled its readiness to join an SRS-led coalition government.

  Decision to build more mosques in Sarajevo sparks new debate  14/05/2008 A recent push by Bosnia and Herzegovina's Islamic community to build more mosques in the capital sparked a debate over multi-ethnicity, religious tolerance and alleged pro-Islamic sympathies of the nation's authorities.   By Azra Martin for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo � 14/05/08 Since the Islamic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) announced plans to build several more mosques in Sarajevo, a vigorous debate on the issue has resurfaced. 
 The For a European Serbia coalition, led by Tadic's Democratic Party (DS), won with 39% of the vote and will hold 102 of the 250 seats in parliament. 
 But it fell short of a 126-seat majority. 
 The second- and third-place finishers -- the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the coalition of outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and New Serbia (NS) -- won 78 and 30 seats, respectively. 
 The two quickly worked to form a government, but they, too, lack the necessary 126 seats. 
 The coalition around late strongman Slobodan Milosevic's SPS, which took fourth in Sunday's vote, winning 20 parliamentary seats, thus emerged as the kingmaker. 
 The staunchly pro-Western Liberal Democratic Party won 13 seats, while the ethnic alliances of Bosniaks, Hungarians and Albanians of the Presevo Valley will have a combined seven seats. 
 Meanwhile, according to Serbian media, at a press conference in Belgrade on Thursday, Radical Party head Aleksandar Vucic said that the SRS, the DSS and the SPS have �agreed [on] the principles" for the majority coalition in the Belgrade city council.

  Brucellosis on the rise in Bosnia and Herzegovina  28/05/2008 Although a brucellosis epidemic is raging across the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, measures to prevent its spread are not in place.   By Jusuf Ramadanovic for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo -- 28/05/08 Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is experiencing an epidemic of brucellosis and must keep the disease from spreading among humans and animals, warned students of the University of Sarajevo�s veterinary department in April at a round table titled "Brucellosis in BiH". 
 Brucellosis, also called undulant fever, or Malta fever in humans, is a highly contagious disease spread by contact with infected animals, eating raw meat or unpasteurised cheese or drinking infected milk. 
 According to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate is usually less than 2% and is usually associated with endocarditis. 
 "Under current treatment, humans recover pretty quickly; however, doctors always emphasise that there is a possibility of relapse -- the return of the symptoms if immunity weakens or if there is new contact with the disease," explained Professor Tarik Bajrovic of the University of Sarajevo's veterinary department. 
 The system for protection against contagious livestock diseases in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) functions poorly and is cause for alarm. 
 In that conflict's aftermath, the prevalence of the disease, previously unknown in BiH, worsened dramatically. 
 Since then, the disease has spread. 
 He says the government inadequately implemented measures to eradicate the disease. 
 The veterinary system in BiH may be facing one of its most difficult tasks -- somehow shielding the public from diseases even though adequate protection is nonexistent.

  Socialists to decide Serbia's political future   03/06/2008 The Socialist Party of Serbia-led bloc can decide the composition of a new Serbian government and which path Serbia will take -- but the bloc lacks a unified stand on future coalition partners.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 03/06/08 The three-party coalition led by the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), which has only 20 seats in parliament and polled about 8% in the May 11th elections, can decide who will form the new Serbian government.

  Bucharest elects its first independent mayor  18/06/2008 Now that Bucharest has elected its first independent as mayor, the various political parties are talking about forming coalitions for the upcoming general elections.  By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 18/06/08 Independent Sorin Oprescu won Bucharest's mayoral runoff on Sunday (June 15th), beating Liberal Democrat Vasile Blaga by 57% to 43%, according to the Municipal Electoral Bureau (BEM). 
 He added, "Performance at City Hall, independence in the council and results in the field. 
 These will guide my tenure Among his priorities are turning Bucharest into an "IT city" by promoting public-private partnerships, developing roads and infrastructure, organising a referendum on the long-standing stray-dog issue, creating a master plan for attracting EU funds and turning Bucharest into a city "to live in, not just to inhabit". 
 Oprescu is a surgeon and professor who ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1998 and 2000. 
 A mainstay of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), Oprescu withdrew from the leftist party in April after 13 years amid internal dissension over determining the mayoral candidate. 
 His job at City Hall will not be easy, analysts say, mainly after the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) and the New Generation Party struck a deal Tuesday to form the majority in the capital's General Council, where the two parties will hold 28 of the 55 seats.

  Fiat coming to Serbia  02/07/2008 A well-known carmaker is investing in Serbia, maybe presaging a surge of foreign investment as President Boris Tadic nominates an EU-friendly prime minister.  By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 02/07/08 With confirmation of a pro-EU government in Belgrade expected this week, the announcement in May that the Italian automaker Fiat is coming to Serbia may foreshadow a surge in western investment. 
 Fiat reached an agreement with the Serbian government before the May 11th elections about investing in Zastava, an existing auto plant, in the city of Kragujevac. 
 The Fiat move will create 10,000 jobs, and Fiat plans to assemble complete cars in Serbia by the end of 2009. 
 This is the "job of the century" for Kragujevac, a city in central Serbia, where economic transitions cost many workers their jobs. 
 Next year Fiat plans to produce around 200,000 cars in Serbia, and by the end of 2010 that number should grow to 300,000. 
 These cars will debut soon on the world stage. 
 The treaty allows duty-free export of cars made in Serbia. 
 "Everyone who speaks against [the SAA] forgets that EU can lift duties not only for exporting cars but also for all other groups of products. 
 After signing this memorandum, the city of Kragujevac will exempt Fiat from local taxes and will provide free land for any additional buildings.

 It expects the prospective strategic partner to purchase one more airplane, possibly a jet airliner. 
 He pointed out that even much-larger carriers like Serbian JAT or Croatian Airlines currently operate at a loss. 
 The Agency for Privatisation in FBiH considers the partial privatisation an exceptional bargain for investors, because BH Airlines is the only BiH air carrier that has the potential to open new routes and markets and increase its rider load significantly. 
 As for post-privatisation plans, once the fleet increases, the carrier has announced its intention to introduce flights to London, Amsterdam and Scandinavian cities. 
  Macedonia's Galicnik Festival keeps up tradition   17/07/2008 This year marks the 45th staging of the Galicnik Wedding Festival in a village southwest of Skopje.

 Hadley, turning to strategic issues, expressed willingness to further improve co-operation between Washington and Ankara. 
 He elaborated on the recent decision by Washington to participate in EU-Iranian nuclear negotiations and to assess the likelihood of a diplomatic solution. 
 Pushed to the wall by the soaring cost of gasoline, more drivers are converting their cars to autogas. 
 Cars running on autogas reduce environmental pollution, as autogas does not contain lead or sulfur. 
 In addition, the emission of carbon monoxide is half as much as that of gasoline, with even less carbon dioxide. 
 The engine life of the autogas-powered cars is generally longer. 
 Other drivers cope by blending old and new household oil and using the mixture to fuel their cars. 
 "This bill is utterly unacceptable in an EU-member country," international media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said after Romania's 137-seat Senate adopted the controversial amendments to the country's audiovisual law.

  Aegean refugee children attend reunion in Skopje amid controversy  22/07/2008 With Athens and Skopje in sharp disagreement over claims of a Macedonian minority in Greece, more than 6,000 refugees from the Greek civil war gathered to commemorate their exodus and to press for rights.  By Marina Stojanovska and Christos Ringas for Southeast European Times in Skopje and Athens -- 22/07/08 Refugees who left Aegean Macedonia as children during the turbulence of the Greek civil war gathered in Skopje on Friday (July 18th) to commemorate the 60th anniversary of their exodus. 
 With negotiations between Athens and Skopje over the name issue still at an impasse, the government of Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has sought to up the ante by bringing minority issues to the table. 
 Athens should correct the "historical mistakes of the past" to pave the way for better ties, he wrote. 
 Gruevski also sent a letter to European Commission (EC) President Manuel Barroso urging the EC to ensure that Greece respects the right to free expression of ethnicity. 
 Athens has no intention of discussing such issues, Karamanlis said, adding that they fall outside the scope of the name talks.

 The indictment also alleges that from May 1992, forces under Mladic's command sniped at and shelled the city of Sarajevo, killing and wounding civilians and thereby inflicting terror on the population. 
 Following the end of the conflict in BiH, Mladic returned to Belgrade, where he lived freely under the protection of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and often appeared at football matches, in restaurants and on Montenegrin beaches. 
 But former chief ICTY prosecutor Carla del Ponte repeatedly insisted that the fugitive was in Serbia, enjoying military protection. 
 On June 4th 2004, a judge at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) confirmed an indictment, signed by then-chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, against former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic. 
 On the morning of July 13th that year, officials of The Hague tribunal handed over the document and an arrest warrant -- both under seal -- to the Serbian foreign ministry, asking authorities "to act with all due diligence and within 72 hours". 
 Seven hours later, Hadzic, who was living in a villa in the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad at the time, left his home carrying a large bag and disappeared. 
 After being told that Hadzic was impossible to find and that his whereabouts were unknown, the ICTY made public the indictment against him on July 16th 2004, since what was supposed to be a sealed document had already reached the press. 
 Among the cases of alleged war crimes against Croats and other non-Serbs that the indictment cites is the murder in November 1991 of 264 Croatian prisoners of war whom Serbian forces took from a Vukovar hospital and shot dead at the Ovcara farm, about 5km south of the city. 
 Hadzic also faces charges of involvement in the extermination or murder of hundreds of civilians, including women and elderly persons, in several villages in Eastern Slavonija. 
 The indictment also details an event on October 18th 1991, in which forces under Hadzic's command, members of the paramilitary Dusan Silni unit and Serbian troops, forced 50 Croat detainees to march into a minefield on the outskirts of the village of Lovas, about 20km southwest of Vukovar. 
 The indictment charges him with four counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of violations of the laws or customs of war for persecution; murders; plunder of property; wanton destruction of cities, towns and villages; deportation and other inhumane acts allegedly committed during the operation. 
 Gotovina was dismissed by Stipe Mesic on September 29, 2000, who won the Croatian presidential election in February of that year In a report to the UN Security Council on November 23rd 2004, then ICTY chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said the ex-general had disappeared in June 2001 after Croatian authorities informed him that there was a sealed indictment against him. 
 Bulgaria was among the 14 countries participating in the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 and has won a total of 207 medals in summer games. 
 Bulgaria, however, took away only 12 medals from the Athens Olympics in 2004. 
 Lalova, whose personal best in the 100m sprint is 10.77 seconds, finished fourth in Athens.

 Bahri took silver in the men's 80kg category in Athens. 
 Asked if he had any complaints about his treatment at the tribunal's detention facility near a seaside resort, Karadzic smiled, saying he had been "in worse places". 
 "I am really honoured, but I would rather be the one who will carry the flag at the closing ceremony, because that duty will go to the athlete who achieves the best result at the Games," said Mekic. 
 Swimmer Nisic, currently studying in the United States, had several outstanding results in US university meets. 
 Shot-putter Alic, from a village near Srebrenica, is currently the best in the Balkans.

  Greece assesses costs, benefits of Athens Olympiad  07/08/2008 With the Summer Games poised to begin in Beijing, Athens looks back proudly on the Olympics it hosted in 2004 but weighs the price it paid.  By Christos Ringas for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 07/08/08 Almost four years have passed since the Olympic flame burned in Athens's Olympic Stadium, heralding the start of the last Summer Games. 
 In the run-up to that memorable occasion, Athens enjoyed a construction boom not seen since the Periclean age. 
 Another host city, Montreal, needed 30 years to pay off the deficit it incurred from the 1976 Olympiad. 
 The major problem was and still is the use of the costly infrastructure that Athens inherited. 
 There are plans to convert that weightlifting arena into university classrooms, and the badminton arena is now a 2,000-seat theatre. 
 Athens sought to shake off its image as the capital of the EU's poorest Western member and by all accounts successfully hosted the world's greatest sporting event. 
 We won the gold in Athens, but we were a different team in 2004," Nicolae Forminte, the women's gymnastics coach, said.

 At the same time, however, Russian troops continued to build trenches in a nearby location and reportedly captured 21 Georgian soldiers in the Black Sea port city of Poti, which remained under Russian control. 
 Also on Tuesday, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, by telephone that most of the Russian forces would withdraw from Georgia by Friday but that some troops would remain in a buffer zone around South Ossetia.

  Greece' s Athanasia Tsoumeleka competed in the women's 20km walk, finishing in ninth-place with a time of 1:27:54. 
 The disposal capacity there is only 100 tonnes per year, a pace at which BiH would need 25 years to eliminate this menace. 
 The plan is to expand capacity at the Pretis factory, as well as the military-technical factory in Doboj, which would require 366,000 euros to modernise and upgrade, and the Binas factory in Bugojno, which would require 103,000 euros. 
  Athens, Skopje trade accusations over deadlocked name talks   26/08/2008 Talks on the long-running name dispute between Greece and Macedonia appear set to drag on, as the process remains deadlocked and the prospects for a solution slim.

 Romania will be represented in the Games by cyclists Carol Eduard Novak, Arnold Csaba Butu, Lehel Ruzsa, tennis player Crina Steliana Tugui and Corina Viorica Custura, a power-lifter. 
 Turkey, whose shooter Muharrem Korhan Yamac won the country's two medals at the Athens Paralympics, hopes to see its 16 representatives, including eight women, do much better this time around. 
 "Eight Turkish athletes competed in the games in Athens in 2004 and won one gold and a bronze medal," Turkey's National Paralympics Committee Secretary-General Ibrahim Gumusdal told the Anadolu Agency in an interview on August 28th.

 Miroslav "Ciro" Blazevic, the coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) football team, probably has nothing in common politically with the late Yugoslav communist leader, but they say no one has matched Tito and Ciro in uniting the three major ethnic groups of BiH. 
 Without [it], we can't achieve the results we want," he said during the summer when local media, many football fans and various Bosnian players and coaches opposed his taking the helm of BiH's national team. 
 With just one match, he got everyone to start caring about the national team of Bosnia and Herzegovina," Marijan Ivankovic, an ethnic Croatian football fan from Herzegovina, said. 
 The Bosnian Serb daily  Nezavisne Novine  admitted the BiH team's triumph over Estonia was "a crossroad for football in Bosnia and Herzegovina".

  Yugo now a museum piece  17/12/2008 The most popular car in the former Yugoslavia made history, but not for the reasons its makers intended.   By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 17/12/08 One of the trademarks of the former Yugoslavia, the Yugo, began its journey from the Kragujevac car factory to retirement last month, when the carmaker Zastava removed it from production. 
 Instead of losses, Serbia now hopes to export cars to the tune of 1 billion euros per year. 
 It cost conspicuously less than a Fiat or other similar foreign vehicle, spare parts were easy to acquire, and all car mechanics knew how to fix it. 
 Despite the mockery it received abroad, the Yugo was the car most Yugoslavs preferred. 
 The car's prospects reached their apex in the mid-1980s, when 147,000 units were marketed in the United States. 
 In 2004, Forbes magazine put together a list of the worst cars of all time, and the Yugo easily won first place. 
 Willis must have been charmed by the car, since he later used a Yugo to chase criminals around New York in "Die Hard".

  Who will get the lucky coin?  24/12/2008 Macedonians mark the winter holiday season with a rich array of traditions and festivities.  By Valentin Nesovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 24/12/08 "Kolede lede, padnalo grede ... 
 In the last week of December, villagers and townspeople select a "Godfather" -- a respected person whose task will be to look after the community's well-being during the coming year. 
 Early on Christmas Day, in a tradition mainly observed in the countryside, young bachelors in traditional costumes, called  koledari , walk from house to house singing carols and conveying wishes for health and prosperity. 
 It first announced the move earlier last week as a reprisal against Belgrade and Sarajevo's decision to block the import and transport of goods stamped with the seal of the Kosovo Customs authority instead of UNMIK's. 
 Police spotted them the following month as they cruised in the stolen vehicle around the city's Dobrinja area, which itself is divided by the inter-entity demarcation line. 
 Police are severely hampered in their investigations by a system that places the top priority on maintaining political divisions based on ethnicity. 
  "Buzmi" a Christmas centerpiece  29/12/2008 In our ongoing series of articles about holiday traditions in the Balkans, we look at the customs observed by Kosovo's Catholics.  By Besa Beqiri for Southeast European Times in Pristina � 29/12/08 St. Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors, inaugurates the Christmas holiday season for Kosovo's Catholic community. 
 Before dinner, the father lights a candle and invites everybody to pray for the health and welfare of the family.

 The father replies, "Come with God," and asks, "What is coming with you?" 
 The father opens the door and welcomes the whole family. 
 The father and mother then begin to "feed" the  buzmi,  offering it  rakia , cheese and other foods and drinks by saying, "I give you wine; you give me wine. 
 Former Red Beret Zeljko "Zmigi" Tojaga saw his 30-year sentence halved, since the court ruled that he had participated in only one part of the plot to kill Djindjic, namely, an attempt on February 21st 2003 to stage a car accident in Belgrade. 
 Addressing the participants, Deputy Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Stavreski gave a brief account of efforts to fulfil his country's commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), including promotion of a constructive dialogue among the country's ethnic communities, judicial reform, police reform, a crackdown on corruption and strengthening of administrative capacity. 
  Macedonian students say university violates their free-speech rights  02/01/2009 Macedonian students protested the closure of a campus radio station and professors' intervention in their traditionally spirited Oration Evenings.   By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 02/01/09 More than two weeks after a student-organised protest, the student-run radio station at Ss.

 After several weeks of intense digging, an archaeological team from the University of Oslo reported a find last month that could change the written history of Illyrians for a period of their existence. 
 Archaeologists found many sunken boats fully laden with wine pitchers, or amphorae, which date to the 1st century BC. 
 "Desilo is situated at the innermost point of a quiet bay where it was natural to transfer goods to smaller boats, so the place is perfect for an inner trading harbour. 
 With the dating of the amphorae, scientists found indications the boats sank over a nearly century-long span -- demonstrating they were not pirate vessels attacked by Romans.

  Macedonia returns to culinary traditions  12/01/2009 Roasted Tetovo beans and rice wrapped in cabbage leaves are among the specialties in a country known for its vegetarian holiday menu.  By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje � 12/01/09 The holiday season this year confirmed a new trend in Macedonia: people are getting back in touch with their culinary roots. 
 Traditional winter season foods are seeing a resurgence, while the experimentation of recent years has abated. 
 In riverside villages, it is usually prepared by women using wooden barrels. 
 The recipe is simple: add a layer of fish and then a layer of sea salt successively until the barrel is full. 
 "This is more than a bilateral dispute between Skopje and Athens," International Crisis Group (ICG) Deputy President Donald Steinberg said. 
 However, ties between Skopje and Athens have deteriorated to levels reminiscent of the early 1990s, following Greece's decision last April to veto an invitation to its northern neighbour to join NATO, the ICG noted. 
 Athens is also threatening to block the opening of EU accession talks with Macedonia. 
 "Pending agreement, Skopje should use its provisional name, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in all multilateral forums, and Athens should drop its veto threats," the group said. 
 According to Goshev, the public will have a more difficult time obtaining credit this year, even via their credit cards. 
 In another interview carried by the Sarajevo-based daily  Oslobodjenje  on Tuesday, Brammertz stressed that Mladic and Hadzic cannot evade justice. 
 The country will go to the polls on March 22nd to elect a new president, as well as mayors and municipal councils. 
 Both the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and the main opposition SDSM have disclosed their mayoral candidates only in areas where they are confident of victory. 
 The VMRO-DPMNE says that in Bitola and Prilep, its mayoral candidates will be incumbents Marjan Risteski and Vladimir Talevski. 
 The SDSM announced that its incumbent mayors in Strumica, Ohrid and Kumanovo -- Zoran Zaev, Aleksandar Petrevski and Zoran Damjanovski, respectively -- will be running again. 
 Boskovski spent more than three years in custody at The Hague in connection with a 2001 police raid on an ethnic Albanian village that left seven people dead. 
 At the time, the city was the capital of BiH within the former Yugoslavia. 
 The city got its first outdoor skating rink, which both professionals and children still use, especially during the winter holidays. 
 Meanwhile, tourists and locals benefited from an increase in housing -- the Olympiad bequeathed 2,850 apartments and several hotels to the city. 
 "I lose more and more hope with each day," he complained, saying prosecutors are blowing the Ergenekon affair out of proportion as well as unsuccessfully tying it to the 1996 Susurluk scandal, which arose from a car accident that killed an internationally pursued criminal and a high-ranking police official. 
 Villagers attribute this practise to an ancient pagan tradition of sun worship. 
 All that has now come to an end until the summer season, when the government will relax enforcement of the rule. 
 Although he will have to give up his county council seat, he will continue to supervise the PSD branches in Giurgiu and Calarasi counties. 
  Albania's ID cards key to visa regime, elections  20/01/2009 Albanian citizens will obtain ID cards before general elections this summer. 
 Authorities will then use the ID card information to issue new biometric passports.   By Jonilda Koci for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 20/01/09 Albania's new identity cards, which the government began distributing last week, will be a key element in implementing European standards for elections this summer. 
 Each new card contains fingerprints, general information and a digital photo of the card-holder. 
 Authorities will use the ID card information to issue new biometric passports. 
 Around 400 centres opened throughout the country on January 12th to take applications for the new cards. 
 Every Albanian citizen over 16 needs the new ID card. 
 In addition, students cannot enroll in schools and universities if they do not have the new identity card by March 30th. 
 The identity cards will cost about ten euros and will be valid for ten years. 
 "The identity card and the biometric passports both reflect the best standards of identification documents in Europe," said Albanian Civil State Office General-Director Armand Teliti. 
 Main opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama criticised the government on Monday (January 19th) for failing to establish an efficient registration system for the new IDs and passports, while an MP from his party, Bledi Klosi, complained, "Citizens are not [clear] on the procedure of the application for the identity cards, and the process is not transparent enough." 
 The credibility of past elections in Albania has suffered from disputes over the authenticity of identity documents and of voter registries. 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel described Tuesday as a "very special day" not only for the United States but for billions of people as well and voiced hope for more co-operation with Washington. 
  Dispute between Macedonian government and EVN worsens  21/01/2009 Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has expressed disappointment with the performance of the Austrian firm that runs his country's electricity monopoly. 
 Regulators might yank its operating licence.  By Goran Trajkov for Southeast European Times in Skopje � 21/01/09 The gap between the Macedonian government and EVN -- the main hub for distribution of electricity in Macedonia -- is widening. 
 Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has accused the Austrian firm, which bought the Balkan country's national electricity monopoly in 2006, of providing poor service to customers. 
 Macedonian households have been suffering frequent cutoffs of electricity. 
 EVN will have to justify every instance of loss of service and to explain the power outages that affected some entire villages and neighbourhoods. 
  Scandals, unrest threaten to engulf Greek government  22/01/2009 The Karamanlis administration, which won a second term in a landslide, is encountering one challenge after another.  By Christos Ringas for Southeast European Times in Athens � 22/01/09 Elected overwhelmingly to a second term two years ago, the government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis is currently struggling with major challenges that may threaten its survival. 
 He kept only seven of his 16 original ministers, while firing unpopular Economy and Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis, who had carried out spending cuts and privatisations. 
 December 6th set the tone for the rest of the month after a police officer shot dead 15-year-old Alexander Grigoropoulos in Athens. 
 Students occupied university buildings, while rioters looted or vandalised hundreds of shops, public buildings and cars. 
 In addition, Greece and Turkey have exchanged increasingly harsh words in an ongoing Aegean Sea airspace dispute. 
 As a result of so many problems at once, the Karamanlis government is struggling to preserve its one-seat majority in the 300-member parliament rather than embark on extensive privatisation and other economic reforms it had envisioned. 
  Innovation by Greek scientists assesses individual heart attack risk  22/01/2009 Greek researchers have pioneered an artificial intelligence method for calculating an individual's heart attack risk.  (Various sources) 
 A team of Greek scientists, led by Hara Kostakis of the TEI Piraeus Research Centre, have developed an artificial intelligence approach to successfully calculate a patient's heart attack risk by weighing lifestyle factors. 
 These factors -- including depression, education, smoking, diet and obesity -- all influence the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
 OLAP consists of a category of software tools that enable researchers to examine different dimensions of multi-dimensional data. 
 Kostakis's group obtained data for almost 1,000 patients enrolled in the CARDIO 2000 study who underwent hospitalisation for the first symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. 
 After recording details of body mass index, family history, physical activity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes, the researchers used healthy individuals' data as a scientific control. 
 CARDIO 2000 is a multi-centre case control study that explores the association among several demographic, nutritional, psychological, lifestyle and medical risk factors. 
 "This research work has introduced a computational algorithm for effectively addressing and optimising computational time and risk assessment. ... it will contribute to better understanding and consequently better prevention of cardiovascular disease," the team concluded in t he International Journal of Knowledge Engineering and Soft Data Paradigms . 
 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and is projected to remain so indefinitely. 
 Kostakis received her PhD in healthcare management from the University of Patras in Greece. 
 Her research interests include the use of data mining and artificial intelligence techniques in healthcare management. 
 A 45-year-old career diplomat, Lajcak was the sixth to hold the position of high representative, established after the 1991-1995 conflict with the aim of helping the country achieve stability and fulfil the preconditions for EU entry.

  Kustendorf festival honours auteur films  27/01/2009 Drvengrad, the art village founded and designed by Serbian film director Emir Kusturica, was the site of the 2nd Kustendorf Film and Music Festival earlier this month.  By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade � 27/01/09 Serbian film director Emir Kusturica hosted the 2nd annual Kustendorf Film and Music Festival between January 7th and 14th, drawing 35 young filmmakers from 16 countries to vie for awards. 
 The festival took place in Drvengrad, the art village Kusturica conceived and designed. 
 The director decided to create the village a few years ago while making the film  Life Is a Miracle  in western Serbia. 
 He fell in love with the region, particularly enjoying a sunlit village named Mokra Gora on the slope of Mount Zlatibor, and designed Drvengrad near it. 
 The streets of the village bear the names of world-famous film directors and actors. 
 "Emir told me several years ago about the idea of making an art village where he would gather the beginners and the experienced authors. 
 The planned 3,300km pipeline would cross through Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria, carrying up to 31 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year from Central Asia to Europe. 
 To achieve this, they would focus on enhancing co-operation among the EU member states, Turkey, Georgia, and the countries of the Caspian Sea region and the Middle East. 
 During his visit, Jeremic met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, EU security chief Javier Solana, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg and Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt. 
 The two countries also signalled improvement in Ankara's relations with the Iraqi Kurdish regional government.   By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times in Ankara -- 29/01/09 Turkey, Iraq and the United States will set up a joint co-ordination centre in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil as part of a new plan to defeat the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist organisation, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, himself a prominent Kurd, said last week in Ankara. 
 Following an upsurge in PKK attacks in 2007, Washington approved limited Turkish air raids on PKK bases in northern Iraq. 
 "Setting up a [co-ordination centre] � is without doubt an important step," anti-terrorism expert Nihat Ali Ozcan of the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey told the  Southeast European Times . 
 George Ivanov, a professor at the University of Skopje, secured the nomination of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE by a landslide margin at the party convention. 
 After the announced rise in natural gas and electricity prices, National Bank of Serbia Governor Radovan Jelasic said the increase of state-controlled prices could jeopardise the projected 8% inflation for 2009. 
 Slightly over two-thirds of Bulgarian lawmakers, a similar proportion of the cabinet ministers and heads of executive agencies, and more than 90% of municipal mayors are represented on NGO boards of directors. 
  Romania searches for new interior minister amid weakened legal system  04/02/2009 A second resignation in less than a month suggests widening divisions within the ruling coalition.  By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 04/02/09 Romania's new interior minister, Liviu Dragnea, resigned on Monday (February 2nd) after holding the post for only 12 days. 
 Furthermore, the Serbian national team had to face considerable local hostility in Zadar, a southern city that suffered heavy casualties during the 1990s conflict. 
 The mayor removed all national flags from the town's central square rather than let the Serbian flag fly, earning him a sharp rebuke from Croatian officials. 
 The proposed crisis response package is only one of the more than 90 specific EU-supported activities and initiatives the EU implemented last year or plans to carry out this year in eight different sectors. 
 The project aims to boost regional co-operation in the field of public administration, to strengthen administrative capacity and to develop human resources. 
 It also provides for setting up an authority that can verify the credentials of -- and bar from government -- anybody, including the president, members of parliament, judges extending up to Supreme Court and Constitutional Court members, general prosecutors, mayors and diplomats. 
 At the same time, the power grid faced collapse due to a dramatic increase in electricity consumption. 
 The Serbian power company Elektroprivreda Srbije opened tenders for the construction of new production facilities to keep the country self-sufficient in electricity. 
 Experts estimate that, without the new facilities, Serbia will have to start importing electricity as early as 2012. 
 The facility's production capacity is only 400,000 cubic m per day. 
  SCOPES helps boost scientific co-operation in Eastern Europe  05/02/2009 The SCOPES programme -- financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Swiss Agency for Development and Co-operation -- aims to augment scientific co-operation among research groups in Switzerland and Eastern Europe.  (Various sources) 
 Considered a priority by the European Commission, scientific research can help integrate Southeastern European countries because science can bring closer the institutions of different countries and cultures. 
 The countries of Southeastern Europe inherited many structural problems in the field, including a largely obsolete research and technology infrastructure and a dearth of industrial demand for applied research, combined with low research and development spending by businesses, a brain drain, fragmentation of the research system and a lack of linkage among industry and research sectors. 
 Programmes like the Trans-European Mobility Scheme for University Studies (TEMPUS) and Strengthening the Strategic Co-operation between the EU and Western Balkan Region in the Field of Information and Communication Technologies Research (SCORE) have infused considerable funding into these countries. 
 The Scientific Co-operation between Eastern Europe and Switzerland (SCOPES) programme, which the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Co-operation bankroll, aims to boost scientific co-operation among research groups in Switzerland and Eastern Europe, as well as to support institutional partnerships with scientific establishments in the target regions. 
 The objectives of this programme are to manage transition problems; to improve general conditions governing scientific research, thereby enhancing the performance of the research system; and to promote Eastern European research groups and institutions. 
 Until 1995, a large number of small research projects, the exchange of researchers and participation in conferences enjoyed support. 
 The Joint Research Projects element pairs groups of scientists from Eastern Europe with partners in Switzerland to conduct specific research aimed at expanding the boundaries of knowledge. 
 The second element, Institutional Partnerships, aims at modernising the research environment to aid the successful completion of research. 
 These two elements receive supplemental help from Conference Grants -- which allow Eastern European researchers to attend international scientific conferences in Switzerland. 
 Such participation fortifies the international networking that is a precondition for a successful career in research.

  ICJ rules in favour of Romania in longstanding territorial dispute with Ukraine  06/02/2009 Romania has scored its greatest diplomatic success of the post-revolutionary period and gained crucial access to significant natural resources in the Black Sea.  By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 06/02/09 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague on Tuesday (February 3rd) recognised Romanian sovereignty over a maritime area of 9,700 square km -- 79% of the 12,000 square km that Romania and Ukraine had been contesting. 
 The waters lie south of Serpents' Island in the Black Sea. 
 He and Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yushchenko had a telephone conversation on which they agreed that "both Romania and Ukraine will respect the ICJ's decision".

  Security forces co-operate to contain inter-ethnic tensions in Mitrovica  10/02/2009 Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi says the multi-ethnic patrols that began working in the northern divided town last month "create trust in the population".   By Besa Beqiri for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 10/02/09 Two houses stand atop a hill in northern Kosovo. 
 These otherwise ordinary homes represent the boundary between the Albanian and Serb populations in the village of Suhadoll, on the northern part of the Iber River in the divided town of Mitrovica. 
 Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi says he fully supports stepped-up enforcement by the police, EULEX and KFOR. 
 "Police arrested [them] for breaking car windows," Hoti said, referring to a spree that damaged more than 50 cars belonging to ethnic Albanians. 
 International troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) searched the homes of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic's sister and sister-in-law early Tuesday (February 10th) as part of a new action against the top war crimes fugitive's support network. 
 The goal was "to look for information which could assist the ongoing search" for the UN tribunal's most wanted indictee. 
 Aside from presenting the results of survey research, panelists weighed in on the topic "Croatia: tired of EU reforms?" 
 "The objective of my visit is to carry the European Commission's message, to underscore the determination and importance the EU gives to Serbia's European future and to boost the necessary reforms in Serbia," Rehn said. 
 "The whole town is shocked; people simply cannot believe this could happen here," Veszprem Mayor Janos Debreczenyi said. 
 The Greek daily  Kathimerini  reported that negotiations between Skopje and Athens were entering a new phase with Barack Obama becoming US president. 
 "I cannot understand why a country cannot use those names because you can find them as a street in Rome, a city in Egypt and different items in many countries," Gruevski said. 
 Another major difference between the two documents is the removal of two counts from the earlier indictment -- of complicity in genocide and of grave breaches of the Geneva Convention -- and the addition of two new ones. 
 The Macedonian results, presented by Gallup Europe research analyst Andrzej Pyrka, showed that 46% of respondents are dissatisfied with their lives, the highest such percentage in the region. 
 Abdulmenaf Bexheti, an economics professor at Southeast European University (SEEU), pointed out the contradiction of Macedonians being relatively satisfied with the government while lamenting the state of the economy. 
 With the rapid growth of electronic media, medical professionals can provide an increasing range of healthcare information and services at a distance.

  Foster parenting on rise in Serbia  23/02/2009 More and more foster children are receiving care in private homes, while the number in state institutions is falling.  By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade --23/02/09 Serbia has been seeing a notable increase in foster families. 
 Currently, around 3,500 foster families are caring for about 4,000 children, with the largest concentration in Belgrade. 
 The ministry is also collaborating with the European Commission and the NGO Save the Children on a three-year, 960,000-euro programme aimed at promoting specialised foster care for disabled children. 
 Both teach law at the University of Skopje. 
 Under the new electoral code, voters must show their new identity cards or biometric passports. 
 The Socialist Party (SP) and other opposition groups say the government lacks a "concrete schedule" for providing the ID cards. 
 Approximately 3 million voters are supposed to receive their cards by June 28th. 
 According to local press reports last week, Sagem, the firm in charge of producing the IDs, has started distributing new cards in Tirana and Fier and expects to have the cards out in time for elections in other cities. 
 Around 740,000 Albanians do not have passports, and if their ID cards are not ready in time, they will not be able to vote. 
 But the pace of issuing ID cards is hardly the sole issue bothering opposition parties, especially smaller ones. 
 The new proportional-representation system prods them to do so, since it sets an electoral threshold of 3% for parties to hold seats in parliament and of 5% for coalitions. 
 "Forces of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia systematically shelled towns and villages, burned homes and farms, damaged and destroyed Kosovo Albanian cultural and religious institutions, murdered Kosovo Albanian civilians and other persons taking no active part in the hostilities, and sexually assaulted Kosovo Albanian women," prosecutors alleged.

 The British film, directed by Geoffrey Smith, also won awards at Hot Docs (Toronto, Canada), SILVERDOCS (Washington, United States) and the Sheffield Doc/Fest (Sheffield, United Kingdom). 
 She sang with the Latino band Mandinga before embarking on a solo career. 
 The head of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, Goran Loncar, also tried to reassure retirees. 
 National Bank of Serbia Governor Radovan Jelasic disagrees with Loncar, saying the frugal 2009 budget makes regular payments at the current level impossible. 
 One member of the Obrija family -- the father -- died in the incident. 
 In one highly publicised case, extremists thought to be linked to the KLA bombed a bus carrying Serbs who were en route to the Gracanica monastery.

By Christos Ringas for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 05/03/09 Greece may be seeing the end of Olympic Airlines' turbulent 34 years in state hands. 
 This week, three companies bid for the ailing state-owned carrier. 
 A fourth firm, the Spanish-owned air cargo and aircraft ground-handling firm Swissport, has bid solely for Olympic's ground-handling services. 
 Athens has battled the EU for years over illegal subsidies to the carrier, which have been a profound drain on state coffers. 
 Additionally, other NGOs and relevant governmental agencies in the range countries, as well as international institutions such as the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)/Species Survival Commission (SSC) Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe Working Group and the IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, are involved. 
 The programme envisions expanding protected areas, improving wildlife management and supporting those activities through continued research and monitoring. 
 Experts are determining the lynx's status via hidden cameras, research and interviews. 
 However, John Linnell -- of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research -- says such success might be tough to replicate because "poaching ... is limiting [lynx's] ability to recover".

  Missing girl reunites with biological father   12/03/2009 A girl separated in infancy from her family during the Bosnia conflict 16 years ago and raised by Serbian foster parents has reunited with her Bosnian biological father.   By Jusuf Ramadanovic for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo � 12/03/09 Mila Jankovic, a 17-year-old girl, recently reunited with her biological father, Muhamed Becirovic. 
 The happy ending, so unusual for the conflict, came about in May 2008, following Mila's two-year search for her biological parents. 
 At present, her main concern is to arrange a meeting between her foster parents and her biological father. 
 Mila is currently staying with relatives in Caparde, her native village near Kalesija in eastern BiH. 
 The girl credits her Serbian foster parents for taking good care of her and telling her the truth about her origins. 
 Two years ago, she was forced to leave the Jankovic home and join a children's village in Novi Sad when she began to search for her biological parents.

 Turkey's top science and research agency came under strong criticism Wednesday (March 11th) for ordering the removal of a cover story on Charles Darwin from a state-run monthly magazine it publishes. 
 But under orders from the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), the magazine scrapped the 16-page material on that theme at the last minute. 
  Science and Technology  editor Cigdem Atakuman told local media that Omer Cebeci, the deputy director of TUBITAK, which advises the Turkish government on science and research issues, had ordered the change. 
 Representatives of the University Councils' Association protested in front of TUBITAK's headquarters in Ankara on Wednesday with posters imploring "Stop the enemies of science". 
 "This incident is proof that a dogmatic world view that is opposed to science dominates" TUBITAK, a group of academics from Ankara's Middle East Technical University protested in a statement. 
 "TUBITAK is supposed not to put censorship on science, but to open all doors to the development of science," the minister said at the opening of the council's Aegean research and development day in Izmir on Wednesday. 
 The University Councils' Association said on Wednesday it plans to hold a conference on evolutionary science in May.

 The PSD-Conservative Party Alliance and the Liberal Democrats (PDL) won the November 2008 parliamentary elections, combining for 229 out of 334 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. 
 The PNL won only 65 seats. 
 The DPS's trump card is its charismatic standard-bearer, Djukanovic. 
 All other opposition parties are at the lower end in the poll ratings, unable to obtain the necessary number of votes to win seats in parliament, or are far too small to entertain such a hope. 
 Parties need to gain 10,000 to 13,000 votes to win any seats in parliament in a country of 500,000 registered voters. 
 "They have told me their company is very weak financially and it would be difficult to save it," Oscarson said.

By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 27/03/09 A controversial probe in Turkey gained a new dimension on Wednesday (March 25th) with the arrest of an active-duty colonel for alleged involvement in the murder of Kurds during antiterrorism operations in the 1990s. 
 The remains found at Cizre may provide concrete evidence of atrocities carried out by military death squads, although forensic and DNA tests are not complete. 
 Prosecutors in the case now hope to draw links to the extrajudicial killings allegedly carried out in the southeast. 
 As part of the probe, police also arrested Kamil Atak, former mayor of Cizre and former head of a local Kurdish militia. 
 The Dublin-based research agency Eurofound conducted the survey from September 2007 to February 2008. 
 Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) and its smaller coalition partners -- the Social-Democratic Party, Bosniak Party and Croatian Civil Initiative -- won 47 to 49 of the parliament's 81 seats, according to various sources.

 Four months before U2 touches down in Zagreb, humanitarian and writer Bill Carter -- who originally connected the band to the Balkans -- will receive honorary BiH citizenship on April 6th in Sarajevo. 
 Carter remained in Sarajevo during the 1990s conflict and asked U2 to help the besieged BiH capital's citizens.

 Robert C. Frasure, Joseph Kruzel and Nelson S. Drew," Huskic added, referring to a trio of US diplomats killed in a car crash in 1995. 
 Huskic also expressed satisfaction that Washington has a Congressional Caucus for Bosnia -- further strengthening the friendship between the two countries. 
 The 2008 Balkan Monitor research noted pervasive distrust by respondents of their countries' political institutions, giving them only a "low-middle ranking". 
 Gazprom Vice President Aleksandar Medvedev said Russia will guarantee Serbia 10 billion cubic metres of gas annually from the pipeline's anticipated 47-billion-cubic-metre capacity, a boon for an energy-poor country that suffered in the 2008-2009 winter when a Russian-Ukrainian dispute cut off natural gas to the Balkans. 
 Two years later, the DUI-controlled city council split the school complex: the gymnasium became a separate school called Ibrahim Temo, with a newly appointed ethnic Albanian principal, while the technical schools retained the old name, Niko Nestor. 
 School cameras have recorded fights, but Macedonian parents believe Struga Mayor Ramiz Merko, a DUI member, and his officials refuse to punish the culprits. 
 "The local government accepted this solution, although the Albanian instructors and the city council members hardly agree," said Jamie Hajredini, director of Struga's education sector. 
 The Sarajevo University Clinical Centre's Pediatric Clinic, founded in 1947, was Bosnia and Herzegovina's first specialised institution for treatment of children.

  Bureaucrats obstruct investment at Serbia's second largest airport  15/04/2009 Bureaucrats have allegedly obstructed the construction of a new cargo and logistics centre at Serbia's second largest airport.  By Georgi Mitev-Shantek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 15/04/09 A planned joint venture at Serbia's Nis Airport cannot get off the ground, allegedly because of bureaucratic interference. 
 Austrian real estate developer EYEMAXX, in co-operation with British-based investment fund Chayton Capital, was scheduled to begin building a new cargo and logistics centre at Nis Airport this month. 
 As time passes ... the danger increases that 500 people will not get jobs while the city will lose its first foreign investor in four years", said Nis Mayor Milos Simonovic. 
 In 2006, the national carrier JAT gained a monopoly at the airport, making airline service infrequent and uncompetitive. 
 The airport has tried several times to increase business by opening new routes to Montenegro or luring low-cost carriers from EU carriers. 
 The city's last hope is the pan-European "open skies" agreement, which may free Nis to sign contracts with low-cost airlines. 
 Nis's boosters fear that big investments -- such as the Philip Morris acquisition of the local cigarette factory in 2003 -- will be the exception and not the rule if the city is unable to end the perceived foot-dragging in Belgrade.

 Out of 528,000 Catholics who lived in the Vrhbosanska Archbishopric (based in Sarajevo) before the 1990s conflict, only 213,000 remain, said the cardinal. 
 The group will be based in Mazar-e-Sharif, in the north of the country, under the command of Croatian Major Ivan Galovic, a career military man. 
 The UBP, however, has no incentive to save Talat's career.

 The opposition warns of potential election chaos.  By Manjola Hala for Southeast European Times in Tirana � 21/04/09 Less than three months before Albania's general elections, issuing new ID cards or passports to voters remains a main concern for the government and opposition alike. 
 The ruling Democratic Party (DP) is optimistic about meeting the deadline to issue ID cards to all voters. 
 The government and opposition furiously debate the details, even the very number of citizens who lack ID cards and passports. 
 According to the interior ministry, 500,000 citizens had applied for ID cards by April 14th. 
 The ministry says the process of issuing the cards is under control, and "there are enough applications and time for every citizen to receive an ID card." 
 The SP insists the government drop the ten-euro fee -- which it calls "an election fee" -- and issue ID cards free of charge. 
 The government has decided to extend financial support to retirees, students and the unemployed but to issue free cards only to very limited groups: the blind, paralyzed, Roma and "Egyptians" (Jevgits). 
 Caught in the middle of the political sparring are those who still lack ID cards. 
 Many have decided to postpone applying in hopes of obtaining the cards free of charge. 
 "All parties should meet and discuss election standards and the process of issuing new identity cards," SMI leader Illir Meta said, warning of potential chaos otherwise. 
 It is sure that after Arabia there will be more countries in Asia that will recognise Kosovo as a country."

  Croatia Boat Show weathers storm  22/04/2009 The annual nautical fair in Split was a success despite the current economic crisis.  By Ivo Scepanovic for Southeast European Times in Split � 22/04/09 The Croatian coastal city of Split hosted one of the world's ten largest nautical fairs from March 28th to April 5th, directly in front of the historic Diocletian's Palace. 
 The event showcased 450 luxury boats, yachts and marine equipment. 
 Blagaic has been less fortunate with some of his other ventures during the current downturn, trying to hold car and real estate shows but without success. 
 "The fact that the Croatia Boat Show is among the top ten nautical fairs in the world is extremely important�At the moment, during the current global economic crisis, when many fairs closed their doors, Split offers the Croatia Boat Show, which attracts many foreign tourists," said Bajs. 
 The European Commission (EC) proposed the package in 2007 to further liberalise the EU gas and electricity markets. 
 The initial proposals called for full separation of the network operation of electricity and gas from supply and generation activities. 
 One would force electricity and gas companies to split their production and transmission businesses. 
 The new legislation sets the stage for better protection of the rights of consumers, who would be able to change their gas and electricity suppliers within three weeks for free. 
 They would also have greater control over their energy bills, as they will have access to all relevant data concerning their gas and electricity consumption. 
 In a few seconds, the mobile system can identify the radiography of a car, truck, container or any other object of similar size. 
 "We hope our success will be an example for other companies and will change the government's attitude towards research," MB Technology Executive Manager Constantin Sima told  Southeast European Times .

  Split aims to become 2020 European Capital of Culture  29/04/2009 City leaders are considering innovative ideas to strengthen Split's case for an EU honour.  By Ivo Scepanovic for Southeast European Times in Split -- 29/04/09 Croatia's second largest city, Split, has roots dating to antiquity, but its active contemporary scene includes a vibrant artistic side, complete with numerous museums and galleries, a well-known summer music festival and concerts, a famed national theatre, excellent restaurants and a lively waterfront, the  Riva . 
 In March, Mayor Ivan Kuret announced that the 1,700-year-old Adriatic port would join the contest to become one of two European Capitals of Culture in 2020 and began gathering a number of experts to formulate a strategy. 
 Those Games brought to Split not only the Poljud football stadium -- an architectural marvel of that era -- and additional athletic facilities, but also improved other urban amenities for the city's more than 250,000 residents. 
 Other residents have proposed their own ideas for the city's 2020 bid. 
 "I'm confident that the city of Split with its cultural tradition and its potential could become the European Capital of Culture," said Kuret. 
 The Roman emperor Diocletian is generally credited with founding the city.

 The current protesters want education officials to back down and abolish university fees, arguing that these devastate the already overburdened average family budget. 
  Bribe scandal rocks Romanian football  05/05/2009 Romania's latest match-rigging case casts a wide net, implicating business tycoons, government officials, and referees.  By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 05/05/09 Romanian football has been tainted by scandal in recent years, and now a new case has implicated high-ranking officials of the sport. 
 A first league football club owner, the head of the referees' commission and four referees are on trial for rigging matches. 
 "Cornel Penescu paid, in two stages, about 70,000 euros � to appoint referees accepted by the first defendant for the matches played by FC Arges during the 2008-2009 season and to promote � a referee favoured by [him]", read a press release issued by the National Anti-corruption Department (DNA) in Pitesti, where FC Arges is headquartered. 
 Caught off guard by the scope of the case, the Romanian Football Federation (FRF) decided to assign referees for the remaining matches this season by drawing lots. 
 Investigations suggest the scope of the fraud extends well beyond football. 
 For instance, Penescu wished to keep his supermarket chain, Pic SA, free of government inspections, so he allegedly bribed the head of the Arges County Consumer Protection Office, Dan Cristian Libertatu, paying him 4,000 euros not to carry out his office's duties. 
 An earlier investigation into bribery in Romanian football involved the FC Steaua owner, George Becali. 
 On the day of the match, DNA prosecutors caught an official of FC Steaua carrying a suitcase containing the 1.7m euros. 
 In September 2007, the UN court convicted former Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) Major Veselin Sljivancanin, 55, of aiding and abetting the torture of the prisoners seized from a hospital in the city of Vukovar but cleared him of responsibility for their eventual execution.

  Macedonia turns to universal health insurance  07/05/2009 The Macedonian government changed the Law on Public Health to ensure primary health care for all.  By Goran Trajkov for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 07/05/09 Thousands of Macedonian citizens, who previously had access only to emergency health care and certain hospital services, are now eligible to receive free primary care through the government. 
 The government will underwrite the newly eligible patients' coverage, enabling them to receive health care services on the same footing as those who are employed and pay for health insurance. 
 Universal health insurance covers unlimited visits to a personal primary care physician, preventive care and examinations and treatment abroad. 
 Patients with specific contagious diseases will also be able to receive treatment under the plan, unless they have other insurance. 
 According to initial financial projections, this new health care system will cost more than 5m euros to implement. 
 While society generally welcomed the expansion of medical care, some doctors criticised the impending burden on the federal budget. 
 According to Dr Gjorge Jovanov, "With the funds that the government is now providing, many of the patients who were not able to receive health care will have coverage, which is a very good thing. 
 Now, with nearly 200 suspects facing charges -- many of them prominent, including former and current university rectors -- secular critics of the investigation are becoming increasingly dubious of its motives. 
 Prosecutors also collected eight hours of testimony from retired Chief of the General Staff General Hilmi Ozkok, who may have prevented some generals from carrying out a coup during his tenure. 
 Arzuhan Yalcindag -- head of the influential Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association -- voiced some of those concerns in an April appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC. 
 "The trial, the way it is being handled, is careless. 
 He also admitted the need to overcome some remaining obstacles, since the three Central Asian countries had not signed the deal.

 Mayors, prefect and municipal heads will run under new regulations. 
 According to the new rules, voters in local units with populations up to 10,000 will elect one deputy municipal head or mayor, while units with population exceeding 10,000 in the counties and the city of Zagreb will elect two deputy municipal heads. 
 The local elections are also important because "they are reflected on the state level," said Sanader, while campaigning on behalf of Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) candidates for the city of Zadar. 
 Among the major cities, only Rijeka, where polls show the Social Democrat Party (SDP) incumbent Mayor Vojko Obersnel will retain his job, has an apparently predictable outcome.

 An independent, university professor Josip Kregar, bills himself as the diametric opposite of Bandic, and polls show him mounting a serious challenge. 
 Incumbent Pula Mayor Boris Miletic has reportedly tried an innovative way to motivate voters. 
  Agreements give push to South Stream project  18/05/2009 Russia and four European countries signed agreements on the South Stream pipeline project Friday, envisioning a doubling of the pipeline's initial capacity.  (The Moscow Times - 18/05/09; AP, FT, WSJ, Euronews, Deutsche Welle, B92, ANA-MPA - 16/05/09; Reuters, AFP, Bloomberg, BBC, Xinhua, Itar-Tass, Dnevnik.bg - 15/05/09) 
 Construction of the pipeline, designed to carry Russian natural gas to Europe while bypassing Ukraine, will end in 2015 at the latest and would cost 8.6 billion euros, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said. 
 According to plans, the 900km South Stream pipeline is to run under the Black Sea and then split into two branches -- a northern one going through Serbia and Hungary to end in Austria and a southern one through Greece to Italy. 
 "Most of this gas will substitute [for] gas currently crossing Ukraine, and [there will be] some new gas," Eni CEO Paolo Scaroni said after the signing ceremony, attended also by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Italian counterpart, Silvio Berlusconi. 
 According to Scaroni, South Stream would improve the security of Europe's gas imports. 
 The capacity boost for South Stream "means one billion cubic metres more here will be one billion cubic metres less gas crossing Ukraine", he argued. 
 Analysts, though, contend the new push to advance the South Stream project was a Russian power play and an intended blow against the rival EU-supported Nabucco pipeline, which will, if completed, carry Caspian natural gas to Europe.

By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 21/05/09 After polling stations closed Sunday (May 17th) in the local elections, early results showed that only in Rijeka, among bigger cities, did voters elect a mayor in the first round.
