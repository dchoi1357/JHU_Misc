       "\"Ok, I am not sure why people put down the Stratosphere, yea...yea the casino action kind of sucks....but don't go there to gamble, go there for Lucky's and Fat Tuesday's....But let's get back to Lucky's....we were here with a couple that had never been to the Strat, so we decided to go before having dinner, my honey and I decided to play some penny slot to kill time, and LO and BEHOLD...I saw a sign advertising steak and crab legs for 9.99, well, most people (NOT ME) would be scared off by that, but hell it was a hard night, I lost some moola and was looking for some cheap (but good) grub....I am after all a foodie...haha, only if you count greasy spoons. Anyways, back to Lucky's the dinner was really good, the steak was juicy, the crab legs meaty, tender and were already cut in half for you....shoot people, what more do you want, what more do you need.....Oh, but wait there's a catch, you can only order that between 7p-10p or 6-10, I forgot, but I do know it ends at 10p. Try to catch it, if you are cheap like me. A damn good, dinner, though, damn!\""

    "This review was classified as a 4, but was actually a 2. The review starts out negatively, using words like \"not\", \"sucks\", \"but\", and \"don't\". However, the initial part of the review was describing the casino, not the restaurant itself. Depiste being a positive review, it's interspersed with words frequently found in negative reviews like \"though\", \"greasy\", and \"time\" (probably from people who waited a long time)."
