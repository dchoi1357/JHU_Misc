Background
Adrenal cortex oncocytic carcinoma (AOC) represents an exceptional pathological entity, since only 22 cases have been documented in the literature so far.
Case presentation
Our case concerns a 54-year-old man with past medical history of right adrenal excision with partial hepatectomy, due to an adrenocortical carcinoma. The patient was admitted in our hospital to undergo surgical resection of a left lung mass newly detected on chest Computed Tomography scan. The histological and immunohistochemical study revealed a metastatic AOC. Although the patient was given mitotane orally in adjuvant basis, he experienced relapse with multiple metastases in the thorax twice in the next year and was treated with consecutive resections. Two and a half years later, a right hip joint metastasis was found and concurrent chemoradiation was given. Finally, approximately five years post disease onset, the patient died due to massive metastatic disease. A thorough review of AOC and particularly all diagnostic difficulties are extensively stated.
Conclusion
Histological classification of adrenocortical oncocytic tumours has been so far a matter of debate. There is no officially established histological scoring system regarding these rare neoplasms and therefore many diagnostic difficulties occur for pathologists.
Background
Hamperl introduced the term "oncocyte" in 1931 referring to a cell with abundant, granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm []. Electron microscopic studies revealed that this granularity was due to mitochondria accumulation in the oncocyte cytoplasm []. Neoplasms composed predominantly or exclusively of this kind of cells are called "oncocytic" []. Such tumours have been described in the overwhelming majority of organs: kidney, thyroid and pituitary gland, salivary, adrenal, parathyroid and lacrimal glands, paraganglia, respiratory tract, paranasal sinuses and pleura, liver, pancreatobiliary system, stomach, colon and rectum, central nervous system, female and male genital tracts, skin and soft tissues [-]. Adrenocortical oncocytic neoplasms (AONs) represent unusual lesions and three histological categories are included: oncocytoma (AO), oncocytic neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential (AONUMP) and oncocytic carcinoma (AOC) []. In our study, we add to the 22 cases found in the literature a new AOC with peculiar clinical presentation [-].
Case presentation
A 54-year-old man was admitted in the Thoracic and Vascular Surgery Department of our hospital with a 2 cm mass at the upper lobe of the left lung detected on Computed Tomography (CT) scan to undergo complete surgical resection. He had a past medical history of adrenocortical carcinoma (AC) treated surgically with right adrenalectomy and partial hepatectomy en block 2 years ago (Figure ). He was a mild 3 pack year smoker and a moderate drinker (1/2 kgr wine/day).

 Overall physical examination showed neither specific abnormality, nor any signs of endocrinopathy. All laboratory tests including cortisol, 17-ketosteroids and 17-hydrocorticosteroids serum levels and dexamethasone test, full blood count and complete biochemical hepatic plus renal function tests were in normal rates. The patient was subjected to wedge resection. Histological examination revealed a tumour with an oxyphilic cell population, moderate nuclear atypia, diffuse, rosette-like and papillary growth pattern and focal necroses (Figure ). A number of 4 mitotic figures/50 high power fields (HPFs) were documented. The proliferative index Ki-67 (MIB-1, 1:50, DAKO) was in a value range of 1020% and p53 oncoprotein (DO-7, 1:20, DAKO) was weakly expressed in a few cells. Immunohistochemical examination revealed positivity for Vimentin (V9, 1:2000, DAKO), Melan-A (A103, 1:40, DAKO), Calretinin with a fried-egg-like specific staining pattern (Rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody, 1:150, DAKO) and Synaptophysin (SY38, 1:20, DAKO). Both Cytokeratins CK8,18 (UCD/PR 10.11, 1:80, ZYMED) and AE1/AE3 (MNF116, 1:100, DAKO) showed a dot-like paranuclear expression. Inhibin-a (R1, 1:40, SEROTEC) and CD56 (123C3, 1:50, ZYMED) were expressed focally (Figures and ). CK7 (OV-TL 12/30, 1:60, DAKO), CK20 (K S 20.8, 1:20, DAKO), EMA (E29, 1:50, DAKO), CEAm (12-140-10, 1:50, NOVOCASTRA), CEAp (Rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody, 1:4000, DAKO), TTF-1 (8G7G3/1 1:40, ZYMED), Chromogranin (DAK-A3, 1:20, DAKO) and S-100 (Rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody, 1:1000, DAKO) were negative. Based on the morphological and immunohistochemical features of the neoplasm and the patient's past medical history, other oncocytic tumours were excluded and the diagnosis of a metastatic AOC was supported. Mitotane oral medication was given in adjuvant setting (2 g/d).

 Seven months later, a new right lower lobe mass of 1.5 cm diameter was found on follow-up CT scan. A second wedge resection was performed including an excision of a nodule infiltrating the diaphragm. The histopathological examination confirmed diagnosis of AOC.
A new CT scan, six months later, demonstrated a lobulated mass, 2.8 cm in diameter, at the lingula and a lymph node block, measuring 11 5.5 cm at the preaortic space extending to the aortopulmonary window (Figure ). The patient underwent a left upper lobectomy and radical mediastinal lymph node dissection. Histological examination confirmed AOC relapse with neoplastic spread around the superior lobar bronchus, invasion into branches of the pulmonary artery and metastatic infiltration of peribronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes.

 Three and a half years post first surgery, a right hip joint metastasis was revealed on CT scan (Figure ). The patient received three cycles of cisplatin based chemotherapy (75 mg/m 2 q 21 days) followed by three cycles of epirubicin (50 mg/m 2 q 21 days) and etoposide (100 mg/m 2 D1, D2, D3 q 21 days) combined chemotherapeutic regiments, concurrently with radiotherapy of right hip. No severe toxicity was stated. The therapeutic schedule combination with ongoing, orally given, mitotane was completed uneventfully. The patient remained in a good performance status (PS: 0) for 16 months and finally died, approximately 5 years post his disease onset, due to massive recurrence.

 Discussion
Adrenocortical tumours are usually solitary lesions and in their vast majority occur in adults without sex predilection []. Several histological systems have been proposed so far in a trial to predict the biological behaviour of these neoplasms [-]. Among them the Weiss system has the most important position and is widely used. This system supports that the presence of four or more of the following nine criteria (nuclear grade III-IV, mitotic rate 5/50 HPFs, atypical mitoses, clear cell tumour composition 25%, diffuse architecture, necrosis, venous, sinusoidal and capsular invasion) is indicative of malignancy. An increased number of mitoses, especially when combined with atypical forms, and venous invasion were best associated with malignancy []. The presence of more than 20 mitoses was correlated with more adverse clinical outcome and ACs with this criterion was suggested to be designated high grade [].
Oncocytic variants of adrenocortical neoplasms are a special subgroup and whether the Weiss system can be used to evaluate their clinical behaviour is under consideration by several authors [,,,,]. Lin et al believed that the assessment of AOCs should be conservative in the cases where mitotic activity, necrosis, capsular or vascular invasion are absent []. Furthermore, Krishnamurthy et al share similar opinion suggesting that the only unquestionable criterion of malignancy in an AON is the presence of metastasis or invasion (capsular and/or vascular) []. Hoang et al. added to the previous malignant features the presence of surgical unresectability and large tumour size []. Song et al. also agreed on the modification of the Weiss system [].
More recently, Bisceglia et al. proposed new Weiss modified criteria and clearly determined the terms AO, AONUMP and AOC. More specifically, they suggested the following: a) if one of the criteria defined as major [high mitotic rate (5 mitoses/50 HPF), atypical mitoses, venous invasion] is present in an AON, the latter should be considered malignant, b) if one to four of the criteria defined as minor [large size and/or huge weight (10 cm and/or 200 gr), necrosis, capsular invasion, sinusoidal invasion] is found, the tumour should be deemed of uncertain malignant potential, and finally c) lack of both major and minor criteria indicates a benign lesion [].
The role of the proliferative index (Ki-67) and oncoprotein p53 has also been a controversial issue in the past years. Some authors have suggested that these markers could be used as potential indicators of the benign or malignant nature of ACs [-]. Bisceglia et al results concerning Ki-67 expression of AONs were mostly in accordance with previous studies of the proliferative index in conventional ACs []. However, other authors studies showed that Ki-67 as long as p53 cannot be reliably used to predict the biological behaviour of AONs [,,,].
Literature review revealed 22 cases of AOC so far [-]. All data related to this histological subtype's clinical presentation, pathological fearures, outcome and therapeutic treatment approaches were studied. We tried to match them with our case data and furthermore to compare them to conventional ACs'. AOCs occur in adults between 25 and 77 years and no sex distribution is documented. In contrast with AOCs, ACs affect both children and adult population (range cited 4367 years) and a female predilection is mentioned [,]. Histologically, AOCs differ from conventional ACs as they consist exclusively or predominantly of oncocytes; however the immunohistochemical profile of both neoplasms is similar. Patients with AOCs usually present with symptoms regarding abdominal mass and rarely regarding adrenal hormone imbalance production [,,,,,,]. Furthermore, abnormal adrenal hormonal serum and urinary levels, without clinically suspected disease, have been noted in a few cases [,,,]. On the other hand, ACs usually present with high clinical evidence of adrenal hormonal hypersecretion (in 4060% of cases) and less frequently with abdominal discomfort or back pain [,]. Literature data show that although invasion of other organs/structures beyond the primary tumour site and metastases may be found in both AOCs and ACs at the onset and/or later on, locally advanced disease does not occur in AOCs as often as in ACs on first diagnosis [,,-,,].
In our case, based on the exclusively oncocytic cell features of the neoplasm, a differential diagnosis among oncocytic tumours, either primary of the lung or metastatic, was needed. The patient's medical history and the neoplasm's immunohistochemical profile clarified its adrenocortical origin, its local infiltrative presentation and its malignant metastatic behaviour.
There is a wide discussion about the multimodality therapeutic approach which is needed apart from the radical surgical excision of the primary AC tumour, its local recurrences and relevant metastatic involved sites [,]. Radiotherapy, in adjuvant or symptomatic control setting seems to be delivered helpfully or as a standard care of palliation []. In clinical trials, metastatic AC extensive disease is treated with mitotane and multiple chemotherapeutic regiments combination (i.e. etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin or streptozotocin). Chemotherapy in adjuvant setting is under discussion so far []. The mainstay therapeutic approach in both ACs and AOCs is wide surgical resection. In AOCs, radiotherapy, mitotane and/or chemotherapy is given individually post bulky cytomassive excision, depending on disease staging and predominant symptoms. Our patient was treated according to the multimodality therapeutic combination.
It is the first time, in our knowledge, that an AOC was submitted to consecutive resections due to metastatic infiltration of both lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes, as if it was a primary lung cancer. In our case, neoplasm spreading may originate in carcinomatous emboli that entered the inferior vena cava; however, lymph node invasion has not been previously described at such a distant site. It is noteworthy that although this neoplasm had aggressive behaviour with constant relapse, the patient's performance status remained well. This fact dictated the aggressive surgical practice.
Conclusion
Histological classification of adrenocortical oncocytic tumours has been so far a matter of debate. There is no officially established histological scoring system regarding these rare neoplasms and therefore many diagnostic difficulties occur for pathologists. Metastatic disease is the only definite criterion of malignancy. Molecular biology and large clinical studies may probably provide in the future more precise criteria for the classification, clinical behaviour and therapeutic approach of AOCs.

Background
Traffic crashes and consequent injuries represent a growing public health concern in India, particularly in light of increasing motorization. Motorised two-wheeled vehicles (MTV) constitute a large portion of the vehicle fleet in India. We report the crash characteristics and injury patterns among a cohort of MTV riders and pillions presenting to hospital post-crash.
Methods
Consecutive MTV riders and pillions, whether alive or dead, injured in a road traffic crash presenting to the emergency departments of two government hospitals and three branches of a private hospital in urban Hyderabad, India, were recruited to this study.
Results
378 MTV users were enrolled to the study of whom 333 (88.1%) were male, 252 (66.7%) were riders and median age was 31.3 years. A total of 223 (59%) MTV users were injured in multi-vehicle crashes while one-third had a frontal impact. The majority (77%) were assessed as having a Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 1315, 12% a GCS of 912 and 11% a GCS of 38. No difference was seen in the severity distribution of injuries based on GCS among riders and pillions. Open wounds and superficial injuries to the head (69.3%) and upper extremity (27%) and lower extremity (24%) were the most common injuries. 43 (11%) sustained an intracranial injury, including 12 (28%) with associated fracture of the bones of the head. There were few differences in types of injuries sustained by riders and pillions though riders had a significantly lower risk of crush injuries of the lower extremity than pillions (relative risk, RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.080.81) and female pillions were at a significantly lower risk of sustaining fractures of the lower extremity than male pillions (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 0.94). Overall, 42 (11%) MTV users died, of which 42.8% died before reaching the hospital. Only 74 (19.6%) MTV users had worn a helmet correctly and failure to wear a helmet was associated with a five times greater risk of intracranial injury (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.2320.1). Of the 19 pre-hospital deaths, 16 (84%) had not worn a helmet.
Conclusion
Head injuries accounted for the major proportion of injuries sustained in MTV users. Non-helmet use was associated with increased risk of serious head injuries. The data presented on the nature and severity of injuries sustained by MTV users can assist with planning to deal with these consequences as well as prevention of these injuries given the high use of MTV in India.
Background
India has experienced rapid growth in motorization in the last decade, with concomitant increases in road traffic injury (RTI) related mortality being observed.[,] Pedestrians, motorised two-wheeled vehicle (MTV) users, and cyclists are the most vulnerable road user groups in terms of injuries and fatalities resulting from road traffic crashes in India.[,-] In actual numbers, over 105,700 people died and 452,900 were injured due to RTI in India in 2006 alone, with MTV users accounting for 17.8% of the fatalities.[] Moreover, fatalities due to RTI in India are projected to increase by 150% by the year 2020,[] with the majority of this increase being among users of MTV.[,] With MTV representing 70% of all vehicles registered in India in the year 2004 [], the centrality of MTVs as a means of daily transport in India is clear.
The nature of injuries sustained in MTV crashes in high-income regions is well understood, [] however, the characteristics of crashes and associated injuries sustained by MTV users in India are less well understood. In this paper, we report these data for MTV users from a prospective outcome study in an urban population from Hyderabad city in India, with specific emphasis on exploring differences, if any, between riders and pillions in injury outcomes. The annual incidence of non-fatal RTI as MTV user among 549 years age group is estimated at 6.3% in Hyderabad highlighting the enormous burden of RTI among MTV users.[] MTV users accounted for one-third of the fatalities in road traffic crashes in Hyderabad in the year 2002.[]
Methods
The setting for the study was Hyderabad city in India. Hyderabad has a population of 3.8 million[] and had 1.2 million registered motor-vehicles in 20012002, with the majority being MTV (77%).[] This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Administrative Staff College of India, Hyderabad, India.
A total of 781 consecutive RTI cases reporting to two large public hospitals and three branches of a large private hospital in Hyderabad were recruited for this study from November 2005 to June 2006. People of all ages with RTI who reported to the emergency department or were brought in dead to these hospitals were included. RTI was defined as any injury resulting from road traffic crash irrespective of the severity and outcome. One person refused participation in the study.
Interview process
Trained interviewers were posted round-the-clock in the emergency departments and mortuary to capture all consecutive RTI cases. They documented the contact address of all the RTI cases in detail to ensure that a follow-up interview was possible. Interviews were conducted using a questionnaire designed for this study after obtaining written informed consent from the injured person or the care-taker, or a responsible adult family member for those that had died. Data were collected from the injured person where possible, or the care-taker or adult family member where this was not possible.
Detailed data on the demographics of those injured, characteristics of the crash, helmet use for MTV users, driving under influence of alcohol, Glasgow coma score (GCS) [] on arrival at hospital, details of injuries sustained, and final disposition were documented.
Injury details
Details of injuries sustained were completed by the hospital physician posted in the emergency department who attended to the particular RTI case. For those who died in at the scene or en-route to the emergency department, a physician attached to the hospital mortuary documented the injuries sustained. The injuries were noted in detail and were later classified according to broad categories as per International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems Version 10 (ICD-10) [] and the Abbreviated Injury Scale[] by MF. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) score was derived for each case [], and in addition, the highest AIS severity for each region (MAIS) was noted. The coding of injuries was not undertaken by the hospital physicians due to necessary training requirements. The medical notes were referred to when insufficient details of injuries were described to accurately ascribe an ICD or AIS code
Data analysis
Data were entered into an MS Access database. The main outcomes reported are the crash characteristics, injury patterns and severity among the riders and pillion passengers of MTV. MTV types included mopeds ( 100 cc engine), scooterettes (60105 cc engine), scooters (100150 cc engine), and motor cycles ( 100 cc engine). Injuries were classified according to broad ICD-10 classifications. Superficial injuries of the head and neck, and thorax and abdomen were combined, with the same process for open wounds, fractures, and other unspecified injuries sustained for ease of analysis and presentation.
Patient and injury characteristics were examined for riders and pillion passengers, with comparisons made using chi-square tests, Fishers Exact Test, and relative risk (RR) ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) presented where appropriate.[,] Principal comparisons for the injury patterns were made between riders and pillions including helmet use and hospital mortality. The Mann-Whitney test, chi-square test and independent samples t-test was used to assess group differences where appropriate.[,] Logistic regression model was constructed to examine the predictors of mortality.[] Analysis was conducted using STATA V.9.2 [] and statistical significance was set at p 0.05.
Results
Among the 781 RTI cases recruited to the study, 378 were MTV users (48.4%), 203 pedestrians (26%), 88 motorized three-wheeled vehicle occupants (11.3%), 36 occupants of cars and jeeps (4.6%), 41 occupants of buses and trucks (5.2%), and 35 cyclists (4.5%).
Rider and pillion characteristics
In the study recruitment period, there were 378 MTV users recruited to the study with 252 (66.7%) being riders. Motorcycles were the most common type of MTV (56.1%) followed by scooters (38.6%), and mopeds (5.3%) with no difference in vehicle type between riders and pillions, ( 2 (1) = 0.9, p 0.05) (Table ). There was, however, a significant sex difference between riders and pillions, with 245 (97.2%) of riders being male as compared to 88 (69.8%) of pillions being male ( 2 (1) = 60.0, p 0.05). The median age for riders was significantly older than that of the pillions (z = 3.9, p 0.05). There were significantly fewer riders 20 years of age (11.1%) than pillions (26.2%) and more riders (29%) 40 years of age than pillions (18%) ( 2 (2) = 15.7, p 0.05). There were few children aged 19 years (3, 0.8%) and 1014 years of age (9, 2.4%), with all but one child aged 10 14 years being pillions. There was no significant difference in the distribution of marital status or educational attainment between riders and pillions.

Of the 378 MTV riders and pillions, 155 (41%) were injured as a result of a single vehicle crash (SVC) while 223 (59%) were injured as a result of a multi-vehicle crash (MVC) (Table ). There was no difference in the proportion of SVC and MVC between riders and pillions ( 2 (1) = 1.07, p 0.05). There were few differences in collision partners for multiple vehicle crashes. One-third of riders and pillions (36%) had a frontal impact, with an additional 8% impacting the rear of an opposing vehicle, 25% were struck from behind, and 27.6% were struck from the side.

 Alcohol content was not assessed for 76.7% of riders and pillions, however where assessed in the Emergency Department, there was no difference in the proportion of riders (55.6%) and pillions (52%) with the presence of alcohol confirmed ( 2 (1) = 0.7, p 0.05); the blood alcohol content level was not specified.
Injury severity and hospitalization details
Of the 378 MTV riders and pillions, 6 (1.6%) died at the scene, 12 (3.2%) died en-route to hospital, and 360 (95.2%) arrived alive at hospital, of whom 24 (6.3%) later died in hospital (18 riders, 6 pillions). In total, 42 (11.1%) died as a consequence of injuries sustained in the crash, including 29 riders (11.5%) and 13 pillions (10.3%), and hence the proportion of survivors was 89%. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.6% (24 of 360). There was no difference between riders and pillions with respect to fatality-survival outcome ( 2 (1) = 0.1, p 0.05).
Table presents a range of parameters for those presenting alive to hospital. No difference was seen in the severity distribution of injuries based on the mean and median ISS between riders and pillions with 8.6% sustaining an ISS 15 (p 0.05). There was a significant difference (p 0.05) in the mean and median ISS for those who died (mean 20.7, SD 27.1; median 10; range 1 75) and those who survived (mean 4.5, SD 4.9; median 2; range 1 25). Approximately 10% of the cases had an ISS 15, thereby being classified as major trauma. Seven cases had ISS score of 75, and in each case sustained an AIS 6 (maximum) injury to the head. There was no significant difference in GCS between riders and pillions (p 0.05).

 Among the 372 post-crash survivors (excluding deaths at scene), 176 (47.3%) reported a loss of consciousness (LOC), though data on the severity and duration of LOC were not collected; there was, however, no difference in the proportion of riders and pillions with a reported LOC ( 2 (3) = 0.03, p = 0.8). Notably though, of the riders (8) and pillions (4) who had died en-route to hospital, all were reported to have sustained a LOC indicating the presence of severe head injuries. Overall, the mean length of stay in the hospital (6.3 days, SD: 8.5 days; median: 3 days) was similar for riders and pillions (t(194.3) = 1.05, 0.05) as was the overall distribution ( 2 (4) = 7.2, 0.05), with approximately 23% of riders and 29% of pillions being admitted for 8 days or longer.
Injuries sustained
The most common injuries sustained were open wounds to the head-neck such as lacerations (35%), followed by superficial wounds of the head-neck (34%), the upper extremity (26.7%), and the lower extremity (24%) (Table ). Approximately 12% of the riders and pillions sustained open wounds of the lower extremity, and 6.6% sustained superficial wounds of the thorax and abdomen regions, and 6% sustained open wounds of the upper extremity. It is evident that superficial and open wounds are by and large the most common type of injuries sustained by these riders and pillions. Fractures of the lower extremity were sustained by one-fifth (72, 19%) of riders and pillions. The most common factures of the lower extremity were of the lower leg including ankle (54, 14%), the femur (21, 5.6%), and the bones of the foot (1, 0.3%).

CI: Confidence interval
 Of note was that 43 (11%) had sustained an intracranial injury with 12 (28%) also sustaining an associated fracture(s) of the bones of the head. Intracranial injuries included for example, concussion, subdural haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage. In addition to the 14 riders and pillions who had sustained both an intracranial injury and a fracture of the bones of the head, a further 25 riders and pillions sustained a fracture to this region but without intracranial injuries. The risk of injury among riders and pillions differed only for one injury subtype, with the risk of crush injuries of the lower extremity being lower for riders (1.6%) than for pillions (6.3%) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.080.81).
We also explored potential differences in injury risk for male pillions (n = 88) and female pillions (n = 38) given the propensity for female pillions to sit sideways across the seat rather than facing forward. Interestingly, female pillions (7.9%) were at a significantly lower risk of sustaining fractures of the lower extremity than male pillions (26%) (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 0.94). Female pillions (18%) were, however, somewhat more likely than male pillions (6.8%) to sustain fractures of the head and neck region (RR 2.7, 95% CI 0.97 7.49), and 8% of female pillions sustained open wounds of the upper extremity compared to only 1% of male pillions (Fishers Exact p = 0.09).
Helmet use and head injury severity
Among the 378 MTV riders and pillions, only 74 (19.6%) wore a helmet correctly (20% open faced; 80% closed faced) (Table ). Riders (29%) were significantly more likely than pillions (n = 1, 0.8%) to wear a helmet (RR 36.5, 95% CI 5.1 259.5). On examination of non-wearers, a small proportion (9, 2.4%) were found to have worn the helmet but had failed to fasten the strap, while another 27 (7%) had carried a helmet at the time of crash. Excluding the 6 riders and pillions who died at the scene, 149 (49.8%) of the 299 non-helmet MTV users sustained an LOC while only 27 (37%) of the 73 wearing a helmet sustained an LOC (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.98 1.85, p = 0.05). Considering only those 165 cases where the GCS was known, 95% (all but 1 patient) in each of the GCS 38 and GCS 912 categories were not wearing a helmet in contrast to 71% in the GCS 1315 category. The risk of sustaining a moderate-severe head injury not wearing a helmet was 5 times higher than had a helmet been worn (27% vs 5.2%, RR 5.26, 95% CI 1.32 20.9).
 Table 5 Helmet use among riders and pillions

More specifically, helmet non-use was seen to be associated with a 1.9 times higher risk of sustaining an open wound (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.193.07, p = 0.002) and a 5 times higher risk of intracranial injury (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.2320.1, p = 0.004, Fishers Exact), with only two helmeted participants (both riders) sustaining an intracranial injury in contrast to 41 non-helmeted participants. Intracranial injuries were examined more closely. Focal brain injury (S06.3; n = 13, 30%) was the most common, followed by sub-dural hematoma (SDH, S06.5; n = 10, 23%), sub-arachnoids haemorrhage (SAH; S06.6; n = 9, 21%), concussion (S06.0; n = 3, 7%), traumatic cerebral odema (S06.1; n = 2, 5%), extra-dural hematoma (S06.4; n = 2, 5%), while four sustained injuries of such severity that they were classified as intracranial injury other (S06.9); all four died. Of the 10 participants sustaining SDH, two were helmeted riders in contrast to eight (5 riders, 3 pillions) non-helmeted participants.

 In total, 36 (11.8%) of 304 non-helmet wearers died compared to 6 (8.1%) of 74 helmet wearers, indicating a higher mortality risk, however, this was not statistically significant (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.46 3.33, p 0.05). Notably of the 19 pre-hospital deaths, 16 (84%) were not wearing a helmet.
Association between injuries and mortality
As noted, 42 MTV users in the study died. The most notable injury types among the MTV riders (29, 69%) and pillions (13, 31%) who had died were open wounds of the head-neck (40%), intracranial injuries (31%) followed by crush injuries of the head (16.7%), and fractures of the head-neck (14.3%). Other notable injuries sustained among those who died were thoracic fractures (9.5%) and intra-abdominal organ injuries (9.5%), while the incidence of fractures of the lower extremity among those who died was low (2.4%, n = 1).
Given the association between helmet use and intracranial injuries noted above, we examined the relationship between intracranial injuries and mortality. Overall, 11% of riders and pillions sustained an intracranial injury, and of these 30% died; the mortality rate for those without an intracranial injury was 8.7%. Consequently, a univariate analysis of the relationship between intracranial injury and mortality indicated a mortality risk 3.5 times higher among those with an intracranial injury than those without s (RR 3.46, 95% CI 1.96 6.10). This relationship remained evident even with age, sex, and collision partner are entered into a multivariate logistic regression model (OR 5.97, 95% CI 1.4 25.1), and these additional parameters not being statistically significant predictors of intracranial injuries.
To further examine the association between injury type and mortality, a logistic regression model was developed with helmet use, age, sex, MAIS scores for the head, chest and abdomen, position (rider vs. pillion) and striking object 'forced' into the model given the focus of this paper (Table ). Sixteen cases were excluded from the model due to unknown AIS/ISS scores (4%), resulting in a loss of 7 of the 42 deceased cases and 9 of the 336 cases discharged alive. Head injury MAIS, chest MAIS, abdomen-pelvis MAIS and being struck by a vehicle in the bus, truck, van category (relative to a single vehicle crash) were all significant predictors of mortality, while helmet use, position, and a number of striking object parameters were not statistically significant (Table ). There was no interaction between head MAIS and helmet use. The model correctly classified 93% of cases, albeit with low sensitivity (31%) but extremely high specificity (98.5%), with an Area under the Curve of 0.85, demonstrating excellent discrimination.[]

 Discussion
This study reports on the nature of crashes and patterns of injuries sustained among a cohort of consecutive riders and pillions of MTV presenting to the emergency departments post-crash in urban India. Overall, 59% of MTV riders and pillions were injured in multiple vehicle crashes, with 40% occurring in the evening and a further 21% between midnight and 6 am, a pattern typical of MTV crashes.[-] Collision partners for those involved in multiple vehicle crashes tended to be large vehicles such as buses and trucks. Single vehicle crashes were dominated by vehicles skidding, presumably following avoidance maneuvers and loss of control, and striking fixed roadside objects. The demographic and crash profile of riders and pillions reported here are similar to those reported from India previously and from elsewhere.[-,,,]
The findings indicate few differences between MTV riders and pillions in the type of injuries sustained. These differences were limited to pillions sustaining a higher proportion of crush injuries, however, the actual numbers of riders and pillions with crush injuries was low. While there were few notable differences in injury risk between riders and pillions, we report that female pillions are at a somewhat greater risk of fractures of the head and neck than their male counterparts, and at a similarly higher risk of open wound upper extremity injuries. As a group, female pillions sustained fewer lower extremity injuries than male pillions. This result may be associated with the increased propensity for female pillions to sit sideways on cycle and MTV for reasons of comfort mainly due to the Indian way of dressing.[] From a biomechanics point of view, this may be associated with an increased risk of being 'thrown off' or falling from the vehicle, with the consequence of the outstretched arm and head-neck complex bearing much of the force. It is notable here that females represented 30% of pillions in contrast to 2.8% of riders, and only one pillion was wearing a helmet. This finding is clearly of concern, and highlights the need for appropriate seating and increased helmet use among female pillions.
The most commonly sustained injuries were to the head followed by injuries of the lower and upper extremity as reported previously from other populations.[,,-] The mortality rate was 11%, a figure comparable with that reported elsewhere for motorcyclists.[] While helmet use was not directly associated with mortality in this sample, there was a strong association between helmet use and intracranial injuries, and in addition a strong association between intracranial injuries and head injury severity and mortality. These latter two findings, in particular, are concerning given that the overall helmet wearing rate among MTV riders and pillions was low (19.6%) in this study population. This low rate of helmet use among MTV users in India has been documented previously.[,,] The increased risk of serious head injury in the absence of helmet wearing as has been documented previously and our study reinforces these findings in a developing world context.[-] The combined findings of a significantly higher risk of intracranial injuries for non-helmet users and the relationship between head injury severity and mortality demonstrates an urgent need for increasing helmet use in India. While this study provides evidence of the benefits of helmet use in mitigating serious intracranial injuries, earlier studies have reported reductions in head-injury associated mortality through the use of helmets.[,,,-] It remains important that helmets used are of standard quality with respect to protection, as inferior, non-standard helmets have been shown to offer little useful protection in the event of a crash.[]
Injuries to thorax and abdominal regions were also found to be associated with a higher risk of mortality in our study. Such association has also been previously reported from a large sample of motorcycle crashes in USA.[] These findings suggest the importance of protecting these vital organs in addition to the head in motorcycle crashes and therefore the need for protective clothing in addition to helmets to reduce the mortality burden in this population.[,,] Information on protective clothing was not collected in our study as the concept of such clothing does not exist in our population.
Importantly, most MTV riders and pillions (75%) were not tested for alcohol use, and when tested around 55% tested positive to alcohol, however the blood alcohol content was not recorded. These figures pertaining to alcohol use are difficult to interpret as bias in testing may be a factor in the high proportion of confirmed cases. In a study of traumatic brain injuries from south India which examined the role of alcohol, RTI incidence was found to be similar among alcohol users and non-users, however, MTV users and pedestrians were involved in crashes to a greater extent among the alcohol users and the severity of brain injuries, duration of hospital stay, death and post-traumatic disabilities were significantly higher among alcohol users compared with non-users.[] One of the critical steps to reduce burden of RTI and the resulting mortality is to have reasonable evidence on the risk factors. The role of alcohol in RTI is well-documented in the developed countries and relevant road safety intervention programmes are in place.[] Our data highlight the urgent need for proper documentation of alcohol use in RTI in India so that strategies and mechanisms to reduce the related burden can be addressed.[,,]
This study has a few limitations. Injuries were coded using the information entered into the study database text fields from the study questionnaire rather than directly from the medical record, though the medical record and autopsy record formed the basis of the information documented in the study questionnaire. Where there was any doubt as to the nature of the injury these were queried and clarified by consultation with the medical record; this occurred in all 13 cases where the description of the injury was recorded as 'bleeding from the ears', given the possible differences in injury descriptors. While every effort was made to code the injuries accurately, it is possible for some bias to exist as the ICD and AIS/ISS coding. This is particularly true for fatalities pre-hospital, as 7 cases had an ISS 9, 2 between 10 and 17, 5 with an ISS of 75, and in 4 cases there was insufficient, detailed and precise information to calculate an ISS score. However, this affected only a relatively small number of cases. In addition, where AIS codes were allocated, there was considerable use of 'Injury Not Further Specified' (NFS) codes, hence it is likely the ISS scores for the cases are conservative.
A further limitation is that we did not collect information from the first hospital the patient attended, and it is possible that this would bias the interpretation of injuries sustained, particularly the objective assessment of head injury severity immediately post-crash, hence we chose only to report the GCS for those attending the hospital directly from the scene.
Despite these limitations, the data presented in this paper provide important information on the nature and severity of injuries sustained by MTV users in India that can assist with planning to deal with these consequences as well as prevention of these injuries.
Conclusion
This study reports on the nature of injuries sustained and associated helmet non-use among MTV riders and pillions presenting to emergency department post-crash in urban India. There were few but notable differences in the overall injury pattern between MTV riders and pillions, and between male and female pillions. Head injuries were the most common type of injury sustained and helmet use was low, highlighting the need for increasing helmet use given the high use of MTV in India and its projected increase.

Background
The prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among street-involved youth greatly exceed that of the general adolescent population; however, little is known regarding the structural factors that influence disease transmission risk among this population.
Methods
Between September 2005 and October 2006, 529 street-involved youth were enroled in a prospective cohort known as the At Risk Youth Study (ARYS). We examined structural factors associated with number of sex partners using quasi-Poisson regression and consistent condom use using logistic regression.
Results
At baseline, 415 (78.4%) were sexually active, of whom 253 (61.0%) reported multiple sex partners and 288 (69.4%) reported inconsistent condom use in the past six months. In multivariate analysis, self-reported barriers to health services were inversely associated with consistent condom use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.25 1.07). Structural factors that were associated with greater numbers of sex partners included homelessness (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.11 2.14) and having an area restriction that affects access to services (aIRR = 2.32, 95%CI: 1.28 4.18). Being searched or detained by the police was significant for males (aIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.02 1.81).
Conclusion
Although limited by its cross-sectional design, our study found several structural factors amenable to policy-level interventions independently associated with sexual risk behaviours. These findings imply that the criminalization and displacement of street-involved youth may increase the likelihood that youth will engage in sexual risk behaviours and exacerbate the negative impact of resultant health outcomes. Moreover, our findings indicate that environmental-structural interventions may help to reduce the burden of these diseases among street youth in urban settings.
Background
Structural factors, defined as the economic, social, policy, and organizational environments that "structure" the context in which risk production occurs [], are increasingly recognised as important determinants in the acquisition, transmission, and prevalence of HIV disease []. In recent years, extensive research has examined the structural factors that produce and re-produce HIV risk among high prevalence populations, including injection drug users (IDU) and sex workers [,]. Homeless and street-involved adolescents have also been recognised as a marginalised population with unique exposures to structural environments that increase the likelihood of sustained and elevated disease burden; however, these factors remain poorly understood [].
In Canada and the United States, it is estimated that between 4 and 7 percent of youth between the ages of 14 and 26 are absolutely, periodically, or temporarily without access to safe and stable shelter [,]. Homeless and street-involved youth are known to be at a significantly increased risk for a wide range of adverse health outcomes []. Of considerable public health concern is the high prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among these populations. In urban centres in Canada, the prevalence of HIV among street-involved youth is approximately 2 percent [,], while the prevalence of Chlamydia has been estimated to be between 7 and 11 percent [,]. Similar rates have been observed in the United States [,].
Street-involved youth engage in a greater number of sexual risk behaviours than their non-homeless peers []. The vast majority is sexually active, and among those who do engage in sexual intercourse, inconsistent condom use is common [,]. Street-involved youth are also more likely to have multiple and concurrent sex partners [,]. Of further concern is that approximately one quarter of street youth have engaged in survival sex (i.e., sex in exchange for money, shelter, food or drugs) []. Among youth who are coerced or manipulated into survival sex, sexual victimization and abuse are common [].
Research that has attempted to elucidate the underlying reasons for increased engagement in sexual risk behaviour among street-involved youth has continued to rely predominantly on individual level risk factor analyses []. However, a growing body of literature has demonstrated that a focus on individual level characteristics (e.g., childhood abuse, depression, knowledge) fails to acknowledge the social structural factors that shape and determine the context in which sexual risk behaviour takes place [,]. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognised that structural factors, including economic inequities, laws, policies, and systemic discrimination, are better overall predictors of population level HIV and STI prevalence []. Given these methodological challenges and concerns, we sought to determine whether structural factors are associated with increased engagement in sexual risk behaviour among a community-recruited cohort of street-involved youth.
Methods
The At Risk Youth Study (ARYS) is a prospective cohort of homeless and street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada that has been described in detail previously []. Briefly, participants were recruited through snowball sampling and extensive street-based outreach. Persons were eligible for the study if they were 14 to 26 years of age, had used illicit drugs other than or in addition to marijuana in the past 30 days, and provided informed consent. At baseline and semi-annually, participants complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire and provide blood samples for HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) serology. The questionnaire elicits demographic data and information regarding injection and non-injection drug use, HIV risk behaviours, addiction treatment experience, encounters with police and security guards, health service utilization, and sexual activity. All participants receive a monetary stipend of $20 CDN after each visit. The study has been approved by the University of British Columbia/Providence Health Care Research Ethics Board.
All participants who completed a baseline survey between September 2005 and October 2006 were included in this study. Since data from just one follow-up period was available at the time of study conception, only information collected at baseline was included in these analyses. We examined as our primary outcomes two sexual risk behaviours that together play key roles in determining the sexual transmission of HIV and STIs: 1) number of sexual partners, and 2) condom use during vaginal and anal intercourse. Participants were asked to report how many different male and female partners they had engaged in sexual activities with in the past 6 months, excluding those with whom they had engaged in sex for money, shelter, food, or drugs (i.e., sex trade work). Specifically, the total number of partners was obtained by adding responses to the questions: "Could you give me a precise number of male/female partners you had in the past 6 months?". Participants could report any set of positive integer values; thus, the variable was coded as continuous in bivariate and multivariate analyses. The resulting distribution was positively skewed, with a median of 1.0 (interquartile range: 03), a mean of 3.2 (standard deviation: 5.6), and a range of 055. For both same and opposite sex partnerships, participants were also asked to report how often a condom was used during vaginal and/or anal intercourse. Possible responses included: always (100%), regularly (50% to 99%), occasionally (1% to 49%), and never (0%). To be consistent with previous studies of condom use among street-involved youth populations [], this variable was dichotomised into "consistent" (i.e., always) and "inconsistent" (i.e., regularly, occasionally, or never) condom use. Participants who reported more than one type of sexual activity and who reported discordant condom use patterns were coded as inconsistent condom users.
The primary variables of interest in this study were a set of variables addressing structural factors that were hypothesised to shape the context in which street youth sexual risk behaviour is produced. We defined: "homeless" as any participant who reported being homeless in the past six months; "barriers to health or harm reduction services" as being in need of but unable to obtain health or harm reduction services (e.g., doctor, nurse, clinic, dentist, optometrist, or needle exchange); "jacked up" as being stopped, searched or detained by the police; "warrants" as currently having a warrant or area restriction that affects access to needle exchange programs (NEP) or other services; "unable to access treatment" as trying to access an alcohol or drug treatment program but being unable to; and "assault from police/security guards" as experiencing a physical interaction with police or security guards resulting in bruises, scratches, etc. All variables except for "warrants" refer to behaviours and events occurring in the past six months since the date of the interview. Other independent variables included a broad range of sociodemographic, individual level, drug-related, and social factors, chosen based on their known or a priori status as risk factors for one or both sexual behaviour outcomes. Sociodemographic variables that were examined included: age, sex (female vs. male), Aboriginal ethnicity (yes vs. no) and sexual orientation (lesbian, gay bisexual, transgendered/transsexual [LGBTT] vs. heterosexual). Other individual level factors that were examined included: engaging in anal intercourse in the past six months, depression (defined using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression [CES-D] scale), and the self-efficacy for limiting HIV risk behaviours (LHRB) scale. The CES-D has been shown to have high levels of internal consistency and reliability among groups of adolescents []. The presence of depressive symptoms was evaluated using a well-defined cut-off (CES-D 16 [yes] versus CES-D 16 [no]). The self-efficacy for LHRB scale is a validated instrument found to have high levels of consistency among at-risk youth []. Responses were dichotomised into "high" versus "low" self-efficacy for LHRB based on the sample median. Social and drug-related factors that were examined included: relationship status (single or casually dating vs. regular partner or married), childhood sexual abuse, drug dealing, alcohol dependence, crack use, cocaine use, heroin use, crystal methamphetamine use, injection drug use, syringe sharing, and binge drug use (yes vs. no). All drug use variables refer to behaviours occurring in the past six months and include both injection and non-injection routes of consumption. To be consistent with our previous work, "syringe sharing" was defined as lending or borrowing a syringe that had been used by someone else, and "binge drug use" was defined as the self-reported consumption of drugs (injection or non-injection) more often than usual []. Finally, alcohol dependence was measured using the Perceived-Benefit-of-Drinking Scale (PBDS), a validated true/false instrument that assesses drinking behaviours among adolescents [].
Initially, we examined bivariate associations between each independent variable and each sexual risk behaviour outcome. Given that the precise number of recent sexual partners was obtained for each participant, we used a Poisson-type regression to estimate the unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) associated with each explanatory variable. Since the distribution of recent sex partners was highly skewed, we used a log-linear quasi-Poisson regression to account for overdispersion in the data. To examine the bivariate associations between each independent variable and consistent condom use, we used the Pearson 2 test. Fisher's exact test was used when one or more of the cells contained values less than or equal to 5. Since sexual risk behaviour profiles among street-involved youth are observed to be moderated by gender [,], we also assessed each structural variable for possible interaction with sex. If a statistically significant interaction effect was observed, the coefficients corresponding to the main and interaction terms were combined to construct IRR estimates corresponding to each sex. The overall significance of the main and interaction effect was assessed using the likelihood ratio test.
Since research among populations of IDU and street-based sex workers has demonstrated that policies and laws promoting the displacement and criminalization of marginalised persons are associated with sexual- and injection-related HIV risk production [,,], we chose to focus our analysis on structural variables that address these issues and thus may potentially shape the production of sexual risk-taking behaviour among street-involved youth. In order to account for potential confounding, we used an a priori defined bivariate cut-off of p 0.10 as the criterion for inclusion of variables into multivariate analyses. Each independent variable was included as a potential explanatory factor when not used as the primary outcome of interest. All statistical analyses were conducted using S-PLUS software version 8.0. All reported p -values are two-sided.
Results
A total of 529 participants completed an interview between September 1, 2005 and October 31, 2006, of whom 159 (30.1%) were female, 127 (24.0%) were of Aboriginal ethnicity, and 69 (13.0%) self-identified as LGBTT. The majority, 415 (78.4%), reported engaging in voluntary sexual activity in the past six months. Of these participants, 288 (69.4%) reported inconsistent condom use and 253 (61.0%) reported multiple sex partners. Of the entire sample, the median number of sex partners in the past six months was 1 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1 3; range: 0 55).
The results of the bivariate quasi-Poisson analyses are shown in Table . Structural variables that were positively associated with number of recent sex partners included homelessness (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.87, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.24 2.82) and having a warrant or area restriction that affects access to services (IRR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.21 5.18). Statistically significant interaction effects were observed for both "jacked up" and "barriers to health or harm reduction services" variables. The former was positively associated with number of recent sex partners for males (IRR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.07 2.18), while the latter was marginally significant for females (IRR = 1.92, 95%CI: 0.97 3.79). Barriers to accessing health or harm reduction services (odds ratio [OR] = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.28 1.00) was the only structural factor associated with consistent condom use in bivariate analysis (see Table ). The results of the multivariate analyses modelling number of recent sex partners and consistent condom use are shown in Tables and , respectively. Homelessness (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.11 2.14) and having a warrant or area restriction that affects access to services (aIRR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.28 4.18) were positively and independently associated with number of recent sex partners. Furthermore, the overall contributions (main and interaction effect) of both "jacked up" and "barriers to health or harm reduction services" to the final model were highly significant ( p 0.001 for both variables). For males, being jacked up by the police was positively associated with number of recent sex partners (aIRR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02 1.81), while barriers to health or harm reduction services was marginally significant for females (aIRR = 1.76, 95% CI: 0.98 3.15). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, barriers to accessing health or harm reduction services was marginally and inversely associated with consistent condom use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.25 1.07); no significant interaction with sex was observed.

 Discussion
These findings reveal high rates of inconsistent condom use and multiple sexual partnerships among a cohort of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Given that these behaviours describe two parameters which partially determine the population level transmission dynamics of HIV and STIs, we conclude that the continued propagation of these diseases among this population is likely. Our results also suggest that structural factors may play a role in driving risk behaviours that increase the likelihood of HIV and STI transmission. Further, the impact of structural factors on the sexual risk behaviours of street-involved youth appear to be moderated by gender, leading us to conclude that the intersection of structural determinants with gender and sexual inequities may promote the production of HIV risk within this population.
Having a warrant or area restriction that affects access to NEPs or other services was the strongest correlate of number of recent sex partners, even after adjustment for potential confounders such as homelessness. Furthermore, being "jacked up" by the police was independently associated with number of recent sex partners among males in our sample. These findings suggest that enforcement-based policies and practices which result in the criminalization of street youth activity may be a contributing factor in the production of HIV and STI risk among these populations. While few studies have characterised the potential impact of policing and enforcement policies on HIV and STI transmission among street youth, several authors have argued that street-level law enforcement promotes HIV risk behaviour among older populations including IDU who consume drugs in public spaces. Ethnographic research among IDU has shown that having outstanding warrants exacerbates the health and safety concerns associated with public injection due to fears of being arrested by police []. Specific enforcement practices may also impact the spread of HIV and STIs through more direct mechanisms. For example, the separation of sex partners due to the removal or displacement of individuals from normative structural environments has been theorised to increase the likelihood of new discordant sexual partnerships and riskier sexual behaviours []. Our results provide quantitative evidence to support these hypotheses and also indicate that more research is required to examine how police and other authority figures interact with street-involved youth in such a way that augments the production of HIV risk.
Our finding that individuals who have experienced barriers to health and harm reduction services were half as likely to report consistent condom use is worrisome. Judgmental policies and procedures, a failure to adhere to sex-positive principles, and a lack of systems that discourage heterosexist cultures have all been recognised as structural barriers that prevent street-involved youth from accessing services that sell or distribute condoms [,]. It is important to note that our findings regarding barriers to health or harm reduction services must be interpreted cautiously, as the associations between service barriers and both sexual risk behaviour outcomes achieved only marginal statistical significance. However, these results do provide further evidence for the hypothesised association between barriers to health care and harm reduction services and increased HIV and STI rates within street youth communities []. Future studies should seek to examine how specific mechanisms or barriers (e.g., stigma, inadequate coverage, inappropriateness of services) influence the accessibility and use of HIV/STI programs and resources for this population.
The other two factors that were associated with both sexual risk behaviour outcomes included sexual orientation and relationship status. Our finding that LGBTT-identified individuals are more likely to have multiple sex partners and less likely to report consistent condom use is worrisome and suggests that the development of interventions sensitive to diverse sexualities and orientations is urgently required. Furthermore, these results corroborate other research in the United States demonstrating that LGBTT homeless youth are at increased risk for a host of negative sexual health outcomes [,]. Our finding that homeless youth who are single or casually dating have more sexual partners but higher rates of condom use is also consistent with other studies demonstrating that relationship status is a strong determinant of sexual risk behaviour among youth at high risk for HIV [,]. Sexual abuse and drug use including cocaine consumption, both significantly associated with number of sex partners in our study, have also been associated with increased numbers of sex partners in other studies of homeless adolescents [,].
This study has a number of important implications for policies, programmes, and interventions that attempt to reduce population level burden of HIV and STI among young street-involved communities. We have shown that the displacement of street youth and the regulation of their behaviour through law enforcement strategies and other legal practices are independently associated with behaviours that increase the likelihood of HIV and STI transmission. Therefore, socio-legal reforms that de-emphasise enforcement-based policies and incorporate health or harm reduction frameworks may be effective at reducing HIV and STI incidence in the future. For example, policy and legal reforms that promote the health and safety of street-based sex workers have been shown to be effective at reducing HIV vulnerability among these populations []. Consistent with other studies [,], our results also indicate that homelessness may be an important driver of HIV and STI transmission. Interventions and public health programmes may seek to target youth who are homeless and deeply entrenched within the street culture and economy, and may benefit from incorporating youth-friendly, sex-positive policies and practices that reduce social-structural barriers to traditional health care environments. For example, street-based STI testing that is incorporated within pre-existing outreach services has been shown to be highly effective at reducing the structural barriers associated with traditional hospital or clinic settings [].
This study has a number of sampling and methodological limitations. It is important to note that, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design, these results are correlational and therefore no inferences can be made with respect to causation. It is possible that the constellation of structural factors observed in this study may simply cluster among youth who are more likely to engage in sexual risk behaviours for other unmeasured reasons. However, it is noteworthy that since all of the structural variables significant in bivariate analyses remained significant in the multivariate models, they do not appear to be confounded by each other. Future research using longitudinal study designs are required to corroborate these findings. Secondly, although extensive snowball and street-based outreach was used in an attempt to maximise the representativeness of our sample, we are unable to generalise our findings to other settings with different structural environments. Thirdly, the low sample size across several covariates resulted in wide confidence intervals that may have reduced our ability to observe small but significant effects. Therefore, we encourage the cautious interpretation of marginally significant results. Lastly, it is also possible that socially desirable reporting resulted in an under-estimate of stigmatised behaviours such as anal intercourse and inconsistent condom use, particularly with casual sex partners. However, we have no reason to suspect that differential reporting of these behaviours occurred between those who reported structural barriers and those that did not.
Conclusion
We have shown that structural factors, in particular those that correspond to the displacement, regulation, and criminalization of street youth activity, are correlated with behaviours which increase the likelihood for HIV and STI transmission. Furthermore, street-involved youth who report barriers to traditional health or harm reduction services are more likely to engage in sexual risk behaviours that put them at an increased risk for the acquisition and transmission of these diseases. Structural factors remained associated with the drivers of HIV and STI transmission independently of individual, social, and drug-related characteristics; therefore, structural interventions that incorporate youth-friendly, accessible, health-based policies and practices may be effective at improving population level sexual health outcomes. These findings support the need for innovative interventions including legal reforms, non-coercive policing practices, and street-based outreach and sexual health services to reduce the prevalence of HIV and other STIs among marginalised youth populations in the future.

Background
Women aged 2545 years represent a high risk group for weight gain and those with children are at increased risk because of weight gain associated with pregnancy and subsequent lifestyle change. Average self-reported weight gain is approximately 0.60 kg per year, and weight gain is associated with increased risk of chronic disease. There are barriers to reaching, engaging and delivering lifestyle interventions to prevent weight gain in this population.
Methods
This study investigated the baseline weight related behaviors and feasibility of recruiting and delivering a low intensity self-management lifestyle intervention to community based women with children in order to prevent weight gain, compared to standard education. The recruitment and delivery of the cluster-randomized controlled intervention was in conjunction with 12 primary (elementary) schools. Baseline data collection included demographic, anthropometric, behavioral and biological measures.
Results
Two hundred and fifty community based women were randomized as clusters to intervention (n = 127) or control (n = 123). Mean age was 40.4 years (SD 4.7) and mean BMI 27.8 kg/m 2 (SD 5.6). All components of this intervention were successfully delivered and retention rates were excellent, 97% at 4 months.
Nearly all women (90%) reported being dissatisfied with their weight and 72% attempted to self-manage their weight. Women were more confident of changing their diet (mean score 3.2) than physical activity (mean score 2.7). This population perceived they were engaging in prevention behaviors, with 71% reporting actively trying to prevent weight gain, yet they consumed a mean of 68 g fat/day (SD30 g) and 27 g saturated fat/day (SD12 g) representing 32% and 13% of energy respectively. The women had a high rate of dyslipidemia (33%) and engaged in an average of 9187 steps/day (SD 3671).
Conclusion
Delivery of this low intensity intervention to a broad cross-section of community based women with children is feasible. Women with children are engaging in lifestyle behaviours which do not confer adequate health benefits. They appear to be motivated to attend prevention programs by their interest in weight management. Interventions are required to strengthen and sustain current attempts at achieving healthy lifestyle behaviours in women to prevent weight gain.

Background
Women in the age group 2545 years represent a high risk group for weight gain in Australian adults. Average self reported weight gain is approximately 0.60 kg per year in this age group.[] Weight gain in women is associated with significant ill health. An increase in body mass index (BMI), even within the healthy weight range, is associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).[]
Women with young children are at particular risk because of weight gain associated with pregnancy [] and low levels of physical activity.[] These women are a vital target for the promotion of healthy lifestyles, as they make many of the daily food and activity decisions for families, influencing children, and partners eating and physical activity patterns. [] Prevention of weight gain targeting women with children has potential to achieve significant health benefits for both women and their families.
Interventions to prevent weight gain to date have been inadequate and generally ineffective.[,] High intensity interventions including frequent contact with facilitators and personal ongoing support achieve weight loss but are not considered feasible in large populations.[] Lower intensity interventions hold the most potential in their ability to reach a broad population at lower cost, but have had mixed success.[,] Lemmens et al recently reviewed interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity, but not all of the studies were intentionally designed to prevent weight gain. The authors included interventions which reported the effect of interventions on weight or body composition as secondary outcomes. Interventions designed specifically to prevent weight gain will be distinctly different from those aiming for weight loss or single component behavior change. Direct comparison between interventions to change diet or physical activity with those to specifically prevent weight gain fails to identify success factors, the necessary intensity, cost and address gaps in evidence.
Criticisms of lifestyle interventions have included a reliance on self reported data, a lack of control groups, the short term nature and lack of a clear theoretical model of behavior change. In addition, they frequently target specific disease states or recruit motivated volunteers. They have also failed to address, or report on, known barriers to participation in lifestyle related activities cited by women. These include such factors as the number or age of children, a lack of motivation, lack of time, child care difficulties, social support, cost, travel and convenience.[] Reports on lifestyle related behaviours in women rarely stratify for number or age of children and consequently we know little about the health related behaviours specific to women with children. Large scale, low-intensity, local, community-based, interventions are required to reach and engage women and demonstrate feasibility of delivery and effectiveness in the prevention of weight gain.
The Healthy Lifestyle Program (HeLP) incorporated successful strategies from relevant research into a low intensity lifestyle intervention. We included, social support, goal setting, self-monitoring, relapse prevention training. [,] We measured self-efficacy for specific health related behaviors and stage-of-change. Previous research has reported programs that are personalized with some face to face contact, and include on-going support, provide improved outcomes.[] There is also evidence of short term success in interventions aimed at people connected at the local community through church groups.[] We therefore developed a multi-factorial intervention that builds on existing social support networks and includes personal delivery and on-going support.
The present study reports on the recruitment of a broad cross-section of women with children into a low intensity lifestyle intervention. We describe the intervention, the delivery of phase 1, (the face to face component) of the one year intervention, and report on the health related behaviours in this community based population of women.
Methods
HeLP is a cluster-randomized, controlled, lifestyle intervention. The target population is community-dwelling, generally healthy women who are mothers of at least one child (aged 513 years) attending a primary school. The setting for the recruitment and delivery of the intervention was primary schools in one local government area (total population 130,000), of moderate socio-economic disadvantage based on the Socio-Economic Index for Areas (SEIFA), created from population census data.[] Body mass index (BMI) was not used as an exclusion or inclusion criteria in order to be inclusive of the all members of the community.
Participants were excluded if taking prescribed weight control medications, breastfeeding of infants under 6 months, were pregnant, became pregnant during the study, wished to gain weight or suffered with a serious physical or psychological illness that would prevent taking part in the study. We obtained approval from the Southern Health Human Research Ethics Committee (ref 05187C) and informed consent was obtained in writing from all participants.

We identified all primary schools within this geographical area (n = 22) and invited schools to participate progressively until the desired number agreed (n = 12). One school refused to participate, reporting they participate in many research projects; one did not have enough space to accommodate the program. The schools were then paired with a school of equal size, and each pair of schools was randomly allocated to intervention (n = 6) or control (n = 6) using computer generated numbers. Schools were paired by size to give a relatively equal denominator for recruitment in both groups. The study sampling and intervention was designed to target clusters of mothers associated with particular schools, to reduce possible contamination between participants.
We invited all mothers within the primary schools to participate by letter, then register interest by return mail, phone or fax. The women were given information packs containing an explanation of the study, questionnaires, plus a sealed research pedometer, with instructions on how to wear the pedometer. Recruitment and delivery occurred progressively from May 2006 until August 2006 (see figure ). The group facilitator randomized schools and delivered the program and so was aware of the allocation of participants. Data scoring and entry was completed by research members blinded to group allocation.

 Delivery
Control group
The control group attended a single thirty minute, group, non-interactive, health education lecture at the local school their children attended. Content was based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and the Australian Physical Activity Guidelines and they received readily available pamphlets based on these Guidelines.[,] Participants were weighed, measured and completed all baseline questionnaires at this session. Participants were not given results of baseline measurements until after recruitment so as not to influence participation. They received a pedometer to use as they wished over the year, but no daily step goal. They were given a request to have a fasting blood sample taken. They received no further support, but completed a brief mailed questionnaire at 4 months and return for final data collection at 12 months.
Intervention Group
The intervention content was based on the social cognitive theory, specifically goal setting, self monitoring, social support, observational learning, problem solving and relapse prevention training, offering multiple avenues to behavior change.[]
Phase one of the intervention consisted of three interactive group behavior change sessions delivered in the first month by an experienced dietician and a fourth session at four months. Participants were weighed, measured and completed all baseline questionnaires at the first session. Participants were not given results of baseline measurements until after recruitment so as not to influence participation.
Content included evidence based messages with clear goals on diet, (e.g. eat 2 serves fruit and 5 serves vegetables each day), physical activity (e.g. aim for 810,000 steps per day) and behavior change (e.g. monitor yourself regularly) and written handouts were provided. During group sessions outcome expectancies were discussed in order to clarify the intervention aim, that is, to prevent weight gain, not promote weight loss. Emphasis was placed on self monitoring through the use of one or more of the following, regular self-weighing, use of a pedometer, or a diary. We discussed and demonstrated goal setting, as well as problem solving and relapse-prevention skills, which were practiced and personalized; for example, working in groups, participants discussed their own goals, identified problems and were provided with individual feedback. Participants then prepared a personal action plan to trial new behaviors and correct behaviors through feedback the following week. Women were encouraged into voluntary school based walking groups or to walk with friends for social support. Participants were weighed and measured and completed baseline questionnaires at the first group session.
The visit at 4 months reinforced lifestyle and behaviour messages and repeated anthropometric data collection and questionnaires in the intervention group.
All sessions were held in groups, ranging in number from 1030 participants, at the local primary school. Sessions were informal, brief (1 hour) and accommodated young children. Session times were flexible and could be adjusted to meet the needs of each group. For example, one group of working mothers preferred weekend sessions, in another, sessions were held immediately after school hours to assist part time working mothers. Otherwise sessions were held immediately after dropping children at school or immediately before collecting children at the end of the day.
Phase 2 of the intervention is ongoing support for 1 year, after which participants will return for final data collection. This support will be provided by mobile phone text messages; there will be no further personal contact. In this report we describe results from phase 1(face to face component) of the intervention.
Measurements
Anthropometric measures
Weight was measured on an electronic scale to the nearest 0.1 kg (Tanita model BWB-800 digital scale, Wedderburn Scales, Melbourne, Australia) calibrated prior to weighing periods. Weight was measured in light clothing without shoes with an empty bladder, at the same time of the day, not fasting. Height was measured using a portable stadiometer (Mentone Education Centre, Melbourne, Australia). Waist measurement was taken directly on the skin in a relaxed standing position at the end of expiration with arms hanging freely with an inelastic plastic fiber tape measure. The measurement was taken perpendicular to the umbilicus and horizontal to the floor to ensure repeatability of measures. The technique utilized the umbilicus as an anchor. This method provides an acceptable measure of waist circumference, but may overestimate circumference when compared to other measures.[,] As repeatability was important and privacy and time was limited it proved to be a convenient method. All tape measurements were performed by a single trained researcher.
Biological measures
A commercial pathology provider (Melbourne Pathology) collected and analyzed fasting cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, triglyceride and glucose. If participants did not have the request completed within two weeks they were contacted and reminded, with the aim of having blood collected within one month of baseline. For lipids, blood was collected in SST (plain) 8 mL tube, allowed to clot for 30 mins at room temperature and centrifuged for 10 mins at 1000 g . Blood for glucose was collected in Fluoride Oxalate 10 mg/8 mg, 4 mL tube and centrifuged for 10 mins at 1000 g . Serum lipids and plasma glucose were analyzed using Hitachi Modular Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, USA).
Diet and physical activity measurements
We measured dietary intake using the Cancer Council of Australia, Food Frequency Questionnaire analyzed using NUTTAB95 software (Food Standards Australia and New Zealand). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire short version (IPAQ) measured usual weekly physical activity. Both have been validated in adult populations.[,]
Physical activity measured by IPAQ was expressed as a categorical variable by calculating the MET-minutes per week (MET-mins = MET level minutes per day days per week) where 1 MET is equivalent to resting energy expenditure. Low activity is described as achieving less than 600 MET-mins per week) moderate at least 600 MET-mins per week and high activity, at least 3000 MET-mins per week).[]
As an objective measure of physical activity, we instructed participants to wear a research pedometer (Yamax Digiwalker, model SW700, Yamax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for a min 3 days and max 7 days prior to the baseline measurements and information sessions. The Yamax, digiwalker has been shown to be reliable and a minimum of three days of measurement has been found to be sufficient to estimate free living adult pedometer determined physical activity.[,] We sealed the pedometers to prevent feedback on step counts motivating participants to be more active as has been reported elsewhere.[] Participants kept a daily diary of hours the pedometer was worn, and were asked to record each time it was removed or forgotten. Faulty pedometers were discarded. A full day was deemed to be wearing the pedometer for at least 8 hours, and a half day, wearing it for less than 8 hours but at least 3 hours. Daily steps were calculated by dividing the total steps with the number of days and half days worn.
Psychosocial measurements
The Eating and Exercise Confidence Scale developed by Sallis was adapted to measure self efficacy[]. The reported reliability for the domains of physical activity and eating are 0.68 and 0.430.68 respectively and internal consistency was 0.830.85 and 0.850.93 respectively. This scale has been closely aligned with six sub-factors for the eating scale and 2 for the physical activity scale. These are resisting relapse, reducing energy, eating low fat foods, increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables. For the physical activity scale the sub-factors are resisting relapse and finding time to exercise. Wording was modified to match Australian foods.[] Questions related to low salt foods were removed as they were deemed irrelevant to this intervention. An additional question was included "How confident are you that you can control your weight if you wished?" to measure self efficacy for weight control. Self efficacy total and individual factor means were determined from a Likert scale from 15.
A previously developed Stage-of-Change Scale was used to assess separate stages for physical activity, diet and preventing weight gain.[,] Stage-of-change was scored using the algorithms developed for use with the measurement tools. The Self Management Strategy Questionnaire [] was previously developed and used in young adults mostly female, validated in adolescents and includes items related to cognitive and behavioral strategies related to physical activity. The wording was adapted for this population e.g. 'posting cues for physical activity' was changed to 'make backup plans to be sure I stay active'. Questions were added on diet related strategies and scored on a Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = always).
Statistics
The estimated sample size required was calculated based on a 600 g difference in weight between intervention and control participants at 12 months, the average weight gain in young Australian women (600 g SD1100 g). To account for the cluster design of the study, a commonsense estimate of an intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.02 and estimate of 30 women per cluster was applied to estimate the sample size. The aim therefore was to recruit 110 participants for each group (at 90% power with the level of significance p = 0.05) as 56 clusters. Data was first plotted and sample means, standard deviations, percentages and proportions calculated for relevant demographic and health characteristics of the intervention and control groups separately. Students t-tests were then used to compare means between groups on all individual demographic and health variables. Questionnaires were scored and mean baseline results are presented for the combined intervention and control groups. We used Stata 9, statistical software program (StataCorp, Texas, USA) for all analyses.
Results
Recruiting, Delivery and Participation
Three hundred women responded to the invitation sent to 2530 women. We recruited two hundred and fifty (250) women, who were randomized to intervention (n = 123) and control (n = 127) (see figure ). In comparison with available population data the recruited sample was representative of the population of Australian women of similar age with children, although fewer full time and more part time workers were recruited (see table ). We recruited a representative proportion of single mothers (10.7%) and women born overseas (25%). The intervention and control groups were similar in terms of demographic and health characteristics indicating successful randomization (see table ).

 Participants were required to attend in person for at least two of the three intervention group sessions. If a single session was missed the information was personally delivered at an alternate time. Therefore all information intended to be delivered was delivered to all participants. Attendance figures for the intervention group sessions were 98% for session 1, 80% for session 2 and 70% for session 3. The most common barriers to attendance were illness in the participant or their children or a change in work arrangements. One facilitator was able to successfully deliver all components of the intervention.
Eighty five percent (85%) of women in the intervention group found the group sessions to be very helpful or helpful compared to 63% of the education only control group. Strategies found to be valuable by intervention subjects were 'delivery by a health professional', 'the sessions were held at the school', 'the pedometer', 'phone mail and text reminders', 'having someone weigh me' and 'handouts on physical activity and diet' in that order, and the least helpful was 'getting a walking group started at school'. Retention rates were high with 97% remaining in the trial at 4 months.
Health related characteristics and behaviors
Thirty four percent (34%) of participants were within normal BMI ( 24.9 kg/m 2 ), 38% were overweight (BMI 2529.9 kg/m 2 ) and 28% obese (BMI 30 kg/m 2 ). Prevalence of any type of dyslipidemia was 33% in this population of women (see table ).
We estimated average energy intake was 6782 kJ per day and average fat intake 68.1 g per day which is equivalent to 32% of total energy. Thirteen percent (13%) of energy was derived from saturated fat (see table ).
We obtained 191 complete sets of pedometer data after removing those where, a diary was not completed, the pedometer was worn for less than three days, or was faulty. The average pedometer steps per day were 9135 (SD 3607) in the intervention group (n = 100) and 9240 (SD 3735) steps in the control group (n = 91), and overall 67% of women reported less than 10,000 steps per day. The pedometer measures only steps and is helpful in measuring incidental activity which is difficult to capture in questionnaires. In addition the IPAQ questionnaire asks women to report participation in various intensity activities. In this group of women 45% were categorized as low activity (less than 600 MET-mins/week, 41% moderate activity (at least 600 MET-mins/wk) and 14% high activity (at least 3000 MET-mins/wk). Thirty one percent (31%) reported participation in some type of vigorous activity in the past week. The stage-of-change questionnaire reported similar results, where 40% of women reported they are not active enough and are thinking of becoming active (stage 2, contemplation stage) and another 21% had made some changes (stage 3, action stage).
In order to investigate the modeling of healthy behaviors by mothers for their children, participants were asked what activities were performed with children in the past week. Seventy four percent (74%) reported they had walked with their children in the past 7 days, 40% had gone to the park with their children and 20% had ridden a bike with their children. Ten percent (10%) had done no physical activity with their children in the past 7 days.
Weight management practices were investigated. Ninety percent (90%) of participants would prefer to weigh less, yet only 27% of women had spoken to their General Practitioner (GP) about weight in the past year. Even less women discussed physical activity (18%). Many women were attempting some form of dietary self restriction, as 72% reported they had attempted to limit intake in order to lose weight over the past year. Table reports weight related behaviors according to BMI category.

Eighteen percent (18%) were seriously considering stopping weight gain (stage 2, contemplation) and 10% were not thinking about weight (stage 1). Only 13% reported they had successfully maintained their desired weight over the past six months (stage 5, maintenance). This was in contrast to the 24% who claim to have maintained activity (stage 5) and the 28% who claim to have maintained a low fat diet (stage 5), with another 13% reporting they had made recent changes to a low fat diet (stage 4).
Self efficacy was measured on a Likert scale range from 1 'not confident' to 5 'very confident'. Participants were more confident they could change their diet (mean score 3.2) than engage in physical activity (mean score 2.7) and were more confident they could stick to an eating plan (mean score 3.0) than stick to an activity plan (mean score 2.7). The reported use of self-management for physical activity strategies (mean 2.52) was similar to diet strategy use (mean 2.59).
Discussion
This community based lifestyle intervention is feasible based on the reported population reach, attendance, retention and resources required to deliver the program. Population reach is demonstrated by successfully recruiting a representative sample of the target population, that is, women with young children. We delivered all components of the program and achieved high attendance and retention rates. One trained facilitator was able to deliver all intervention components.
The primary school as a setting for recruitment and delivery was successful, addressing a number of barriers to participation by women in health programs. the school is an existing trusted community resource with strong social connections often formed between parents. This social support has been found to have positive influence on physical activity participation. The school is accessible to most women, often within walking distance, and is familiar. Using the school we successfully attracted working-mothers, single-mothers and women from culturally diverse backgrounds, all income levels and education levels. School principals strongly supported the intervention and actively assisted the recruitment. As recruitment rates at each school varied, characteristics of the parent body may affect participation and warrants further investigation.
Overall approximately 11% of invited participants responded. In the context of population reach this is still a significant proportion. Improving the health of 11% of the population would equate to an important public health campaign. This setting gave us access to all women with children who were unselected in terms of health risks.
As expected, we attracted those who were overweight and obese, yet still attracted many leaner women. This is encouraging for future interventions aiming to prevent rather than treat obesity. Almost all of the participants (90%), reported they would like to weigh less, confirming women are generally dissatisfied with their body weight and shape. More than a third of women wished to weigh 15 kg less, suggesting weight gain to date is small in many women and potentially reversible. These women are therefore ideal candidates for interventions to prevent obesity, as risk to health increases with an adult weight gain of 5 kg or from a BMI of 22 kg/m 2 [].
The majority of women reported they were actively trying to prevent weight gain over the past year, yet few were successful. This lack of success is also demonstrated by an ongoing increase in the prevalence of obesity in women in Australia and in many other countries.[] The data here suggests many women are motivated to self-manage weight, but make largely unsuccessful changes to behavior. Interventions should be designed to enhance effectiveness of self-management strategies currently used by women and target those women who are within the healthy weight range but have begun experiencing small steady annual weight gain.
Attendance was voluntary and we may have attracted a more motivated group than is found in the population in general. As most women wished to weigh less, it is possible women participated in this lifestyle intervention with the intention of controlling their weight rather than for specific health improvements associated with diet and physical activity change. This implies body weight is a strong motivator for attendance at such programs. The weight management practices described in our study is comparable to that described in large population studies.[] Therefore weight issues may motivate many women to seek assistance for changing behaviors, and overall this may be a stronger influence than for single component behavior change, such as changing diet composition or physical activity levels alone.
Defining the minimum level of contact and support to achieve desired outcomes in interventions is critical. Intensive programs increase the burden on participants and are costly, and low intensity mail based interventions have shown poorer outcomes but have higher population reach. In addition women who nominate a preference for group contact do not always attend as planned, [] which has implications for delivery. In this study, attendance progressively declined over the three group sessions. We propose three face to face sessions are the limit for mothers who need to re-arrange usual activities and work commitments to attend. Non attendance may also occur because of a lack of engagement, inability of the program to meet individual expectations, or factors related to the facilitator. Retention rates were high at 4 months and women reported the sessions to be very helpful, suggesting the program quality met expectations.
Intervention strategies such as 'delivery by a health professional' and 'sessions held at school' were highly valued. Similar programs should be delivered by health professionals, a trusted source of health information, in local settings. 'Getting a walking group started at school' was considered least helpful. It was anticipated the school setting would provide strong social support for participants, and social support has been shown to be strongly correlated with physical activity in women. [] However the unstructured format of the walking groups was not sustainable. Future research could focus on how women successfully acquire and maintain social support for physical activity.
Children have been nominated as barriers to the adoption of healthy lifestyles in women. Lack of time, lack of childcare to assist exercise opportunities and preparing meals that children prefer, have been reported elsewhere.[] We would expect the diet of women with children will differ from childless women, although there is no comparative nutrient intake data available. Ball et al report women who live with children are less likely to meet dietary recommendations for fat intake and 'extra' foods than women living alone.[] In our sample, the total dietary fat and saturated fat intake were found to be similar to population data, and higher than recommended by successful weight loss and chronic disease prevention interventions. The Diabetes Prevention Program aimed for a total fat intake less than 30% of energy, the Women's Healthy Lifestyle Project, less than 25% and the Women's Health Initiative, 20%.[,,] A low fat intake is frequently recommended for weight management. Self reported dietary intake is often underestimated, so actual intake in this group may be even higher than reported. These results are in contrast to almost half of the participants claiming to have made changes toward a low fat diet. Overall this is pointing to a discrepancy between perceived dietary fat intake and actual fat intake and confirms prior studies. The difference may reflect a lack of knowledge on sources of fat in the diet or inaccuracies associated with self-reported intake. This has important implications for weight gain prevention strategies suggesting a role for further education on the appropriate quantity and quality of dietary fat intake in this population.
Participants were more confident in changing diet behaviors than physical activity. Women with children are likely to perceive a change in diet is within their personal control and skill level. They may also perceive fewer barriers to dietary change than for physical activity change, such as, arranging child care, re-arranging schedules, cost, weather and a lack of places to be active.
Reported average steps in healthy adults range from 7,00013,000 per day [] and our sample fell within that range. Reduced activity associated with having children has been reported previously [] and step rates were expected to be lower than that observed. Much of the activity in this group appears to be low intensity presumably associated with home duties and caring for children. Women are likely to find it difficult to increase physical activity levels when already fatigued through extensive low intensity activity. Specific advice on participation in all levels of activity, low, moderate, vigorous and sitting time might improve overall activity in this group. The pedometers were sealed to eliminate feedback potentially motivating participants to be more active than usual. It is possible that simply wearing the pedometer may increase motivation to increase step counts in some women.
Limitations included recruitment of a slightly more educated sample than the general population. Education level may affect rate of weight gain.[] Also we attracted few full time working mothers, as the intervention was held primarily during the day. Women with children are likely to find attending programs out of work hours difficult. Workplace interventions may be more appropriate for this group.
We have reached a group of women who are dissatisfied with their current weight, are attempting to control their weight, and are more confident of changing their diet than physical activity. The lifestyle behaviors exhibited by this population are not robust enough to prevent weight gain and are possibly contributing to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dyslipidemia when combined with other risk factors such as overweight, low activity, and poor diet increases the risk of CVD occurring at an earlier age. The findings highlight the need for increased risk awareness and lifestyle change at earlier life stages to improve long term health outcomes in women.
Overall the results support the need for small adjustments in diet and physical activity behaviors in women which is likely to have important consequences for body weight and health. This study is novel as it delivers the intervention in a school setting aimed at the mothers. The strengths of this study are the randomized controlled design, the large representative sample of community based women and data collection using both self reported and objective methods. If successful long term, the intervention could be adapted for use in various community settings involving women, and would be a valuable addition to interventions aimed at children in a school setting.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated that the recruitment of participants and the delivery of a low intensity lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain in women with children is appropriate and feasible. Women with children are currently engaging in lifestyle behaviors which are not conferring adequate health benefits and may be contributing to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. They appear to be motivated to attend prevention programs by their interest in weight management. Future research should determine the sustainability and effectiveness of low intensity behaviour change interventions focusing on preventing weight gain in this target population.

Introduction
Williams syndrome is rare genetic disorder resulting in neurodevelopmental problems. Hernias of the foramen of Morgagni are rare diaphragmatic hernias and they mostly present on the right side, in the anterior mediastinum. They are usually asymptomatic and are difficult to diagnose, especially in patients with learning disabilities.
Case presentation
This 49-year-old woman with Williams syndrome, cognitive impairment and aortic stenosis presented to physicians with right-sided chest pain. She had previously undergone repair of her right spigelian and epigastric hernia. Her abdominal examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray suggested right-sided diaphragmatic hernia and pleural effusion for which she received treatment. The computed tomography scan showed a diaphragmatic hernia with some collapse/consolidation of the adjacent lung. Furthermore, the patient had aortic stenosis and was high risk for anaesthesia (ASA grade 3). She underwent successful laparoscopic repair of her congenital diaphragmatic hernia leading to a quick and uneventful postoperative recovery.
Conclusion
These multiple hernias suggest that patients with Williams syndrome may have some connective tissue disorder which makes them prone to develop hernias especially associated with those parts of the body which may have intracavity pressure variations like the abdomen. Diaphragmatic hernia may be the cause of chest pain in these patients. A computed tomography scan helps in early diagnosis, and laparoscopic repair helps in prevention of further complications, and leads to quick recovery especially in patients with learning disabilities. In the presence of significant comorbidities, a less invasive operative procedure with quick recovery becomes advisable.
Introduction
Congenital diaphragmatic abnormalities occur in 1/2000 to 1/4000 births []. The most common defect is congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Morgagni's hernia is a rare cause of diaphragmatic hernia. It is usually described as an anterior diaphragmatic defect occurring on the right side and located in the anterior mediastinum because of the retrosternal location of the foramen of Morgagni []. These hernias are usually diagnosed incidentally when the patient has reached adulthood, or when they become symptomatic due to intestinal involvement (occlusive symptoms) or when they present with respiratory distress []. The contents of the hernia usually comprise omental fat and bowel [].
Williams syndrome is caused by a deletion in the 7q11.23 region which includes at least 17 genes, resulting in a neurodevelopmental disorder []. This case report discusses a 49-year-old woman with Williams syndrome and three different types of hernias including an atypical right diaphragmatic hernia incidentally diagnosed on chest X-ray.
Case presentation
This 49-year-old woman with Williams syndrome, cognitive impairment and aortic stenosis presented to the physicians with right-sided chest pain. In the past, she had undergone repair of her right spigelian and epigastric hernias. Her abdominal examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray (Figure ) suggested right-sided diaphragmatic hernia and pleural effusion for which she received treatment. Pleural aspirate showed neutrophils, lymphocytes and reactive mesothelial cells. There were no malignant cells. A computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure ) showed a diaphragmatic hernia with some collapse/consolidation of the adjacent lung.

 She was considered to be a high-risk patient for general anaesthesia. Her endotracheal intubation was difficult because of her small mouth, receding chin and short neck and she required a bougie to guide the endotracheal tube. In addition to her aortic stenosis, she also had a significantly dilated left atrium, mild mitral stenosis with mild regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension and markedly dilated coronary sinus. The left ventricle was concentrically hypertrophied and the ejection fraction was 50%. The peak and mean gradients across the aortic valve were 52.7 and 29.5 mmHg, respectively. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with partial right bundle branch block (RBBB) and minor inferior and lateral T wave changes. Despite her significant comorbidities, her persistent symptoms warranted surgical intervention and laparoscopic surgery was preferable to an open repair. So she underwent laparoscopic repair (Figure ) of her congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Transverse colon and omentum were reduced from the right chest into the abdomen. Intraperitoneal gortex sutures were used to close the defect and the defect was reinforced with surgical porcine mesh and prolene. She made a quick and uneventful postoperative recovery.

 Discussion
Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are a rare form of diaphragmatic hernia and present during adult life. They originate from a defect in the septum transversum due to failure of the closure of the pars sternalis with the seventh costochondral arch. This anatomical defect is also known as Larrey's space and usually lies posterior to the xiphoid process on the right side. Usually this defect is small and asymptomatic until adult life due to plugging by the underlying liver or omentum. Visceral herniation of abdominal content into the thorax occurs when this defect enlarges in size, resulting in respiratory or abdominal symptoms. The hernial sac usually contains omentum, transverse colon and rarely stomach []. Increasing weight and chronic cough act as stress factors and influence the symptoms of the Morgagni hernia []. Patients can present with either abdominal or chest pain, or respiratory distress [].
In patients with diaphragmatic hernias, the risks of complications is high, in particular gastric volvulus and colonic obstruction []. The hernias may be associated with pleural effusion or any neurodevelopmental disorder as described in this patient. They may be misdiagnosed as localized diaphragmatic eventration, right middle lobe collapse, consolidation, pleuropericardial cyst or mediastinal lipoma and are diagnosed incidentally on chest X-ray as a homogenous mass in the right cardiophrenic angle []. In our patient, the hernial contents were mainly in the cardiosternal space with two obvious defects in the diaphragm.
Plain radiography may not show any abnormality in a patient with intermittent herniation. CT is the modality of choice for diagnosis of Morgagni's hernia and diagnosis may be established by the presence of a fatty mass in a cardiophrenic angle along with omental vessels [].
Symptomatic cases usually benefit from surgical treatment and prevention of complications. Traditionally, surgical repair has been performed by an open (transabdominal or transthoracic) approach. However, recently these hernias have been successfully repaired using a laparoscopic approach []. In the presence of significant comorbidity and learning difficulties, traditional open surgery for these patients carries significant risks. A laparoscopic repair requires experience and expertise. Pre-operative imaging can predict the nature of the hernias and the extent of the diaphragmatic defect. If the hernial defect is small, direct suturing can close it. However, if the defect is large as in our reported case, then a mesh is required [].
Patients with Williams syndrome have elastin gene deletions which result in altered deposition of elastic fibres in the skin and a subclinical dermal phenotype []. It has also been suggested that abnormal vocal cord connective tissue elastin may be the cause of mild vocal cord dysfunction []. The participation of the extracellular matrix in the development of inguinal hernias has led to the suggestion that a relationship exists between genetic defects of elastic fibres and collagen synthesis [].
Conclusion
Patients with Williams syndrome may have a connective tissue disorder which makes them prone to develop intra-abdominal hernias. Chest pain in these patients may not only be due to aortic stenosis but also to diaphragmatic hernias. Simple investigation such as chest X-ray may be valuable in detecting these hernias and surgical intervention may relieve the symptoms and prevent complications. In the presence of significant comorbidities, a less invasive operative procedure with quick recovery becomes advisable.
