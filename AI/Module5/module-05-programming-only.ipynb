It should be a *single* List of 10 x 10 or 100 bits. In general, crossover and mutation have no idea what those bits represent."

The fitness function used is $$Fit = maxVal - Sphere(phenoFn(genotype))$$ where maxVal is the largest possible value that the sphere function could take on, the `phenoFn` is a function that transforms genotype into the actual phenotype of real values, and Sphere function is defined above. Using this fitness function ensures that the real vectors which results in the lowest shifted sphere function would end up mapped to a higher fitness value.\n",

For those individuals deemed eligible, the program calculates an array containing the cumulative sum of the fitness values of all eligible individuals. The algorithm then generates a specified number of random values between 0 and sum(fitness). The individual selected would be the index of the left most element which is higher than the random value. The higher the fitness of an individual, the higher the probability of being selected.\n",

    "The function prints debug information about the progress of the genetic algorithm. The parameters are: generation number, the genotype and fitness value of the best individual of the current generation and the parameter of the algorithm. Within the parameter, the function uses the `reprFn` which nicely returns the string representation of the genotype, the phenoFn which converts the genotype to the phenotype, and the `f` evaluative function.
